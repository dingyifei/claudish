# Claudish - Development Notes

CLI proxy that runs Claude Code against non-Anthropic models.

Engineering rationale lives in `ai-docs/architecture/` — **read the relevant file before editing
that area**; it records measurements the source cannot show you. Filenames below are relative to
that directory, whose `README.md` is the full index. Parked work with explicit trigger conditions
lives in `ROADMAP.md`.

## Where the rationale lives — all files below are in `ai-docs/architecture/`

- `routing.md` — `provider@model` syntax, every provider prefix, `DEFAULT_ROUTING_RULES`, `defaultProvider`, the derived picker roster, `SUBSCRIPTION_PROVIDERS`, local models
- `adapters.md` — Layers 1–3, stream parsers, error classification and retry, the 400 remap, why Gemini tool schemas need `items` on every array
- `behavior-layer.md` — Layer 4, the harness-conformance supervisor
- `advisor.md` — `--advisor` for any main model: independent of `--monitor`, decorator on the routed handler, ids by tool name, retained session state, stub paths S1-S10, Claude Code's gates, metered panel billing; read before editing advisor, decorator, monitor-launch or native-auth code
- `providers/devin.md`, `providers/grok-subscription.md`, `providers/antigravity.md`, `providers/qwen-alibaba.md` — one per reverse-engineered provider
- `headless-vs-interactive.md` — `-p` is not interactive-minus-a-TTY; an UNKNOWN `--agent` name is
  silently unvalidated under `--input-format stream-json` (a VALID one is applied correctly); why magmux
- `custom-endpoints.md`, `predefined-endpoints.md` — user config; the 25-vendor bundled catalog
- `onepassword.md` — secret resolution, the four denial causes, the handshake lock, route pinning
- `keychain.md` — the macOS Keychain backend: enumerate-for-presence vs read-for-value, the `security` traps, the Providers-tab write/delete
- `mcp-channel.md` — MCP tool surface, channel wire format, progress keepalive
- `team-capture.md` — why `team`'s exit 0 proves nothing
- `team-lifecycle.md` — why no slot is ever killed on a timer, why `run` returns before its
  children finish, idle time as information, why `outputSize` reads 0 on a RUNNING slot and
  what to read instead, and why `keepUnrecognizedJson` is an option
  rather than one rule for both the channel and `team`
- `context-window.md`, `theming.md`, `debugging.md`, `testing.md`

Evidence behind them: `ai-docs/reports/`. Evals: `ai-docs/benches/`. User-facing site: `docs/`.

## Invariants — each of these fails SILENTLY

- A new provider needs entries in BOTH `BUILTIN_PROVIDERS` and `PROVIDER_PROFILES`; a missing profile routes to OpenRouter with no error.
- `apiKeyEnvVar` stays `""` for `devin`, `antigravity`, `grok-subscription` — non-empty means the handler is never built and the model falls through to OpenRouter.
- Never hardcode rosters, context windows, `maxOutputTokens`, or pricing. Discover live; a default is a rule, never a pinned id.
- Terminal errors are remapped to 400, so any `status ===` under `handlers/` is suspect — recover the real one with `extractUpstreamStatus`.
- Read `C.*` / `tokens.*` at RENDER time; a module-level `const` snapshots the dark palette before detection runs.
- A provider absent from `SUBSCRIPTION_PROVIDERS` quotes flat-rate users a per-token price and accrues fictional spend.
- `openai-codex` bills by the CREDENTIAL that signed, never by its name, so it is in `CREDENTIAL_DECIDED_PROVIDERS` and must never also be in `SUBSCRIPTION_PROVIDERS` — the name check short-circuits the probe. The probe is installed only as a side effect of importing `auth/credentials/authority.ts`; unregistered, `cx@` silently reports metered (safe as money, but it also suppresses the `routing-rules.ts:413` cost warning). Probe with `CodexOAuth.hasCredentials()`, never `hasOAuthCredentials`/`describeSourceSync`.
- What makes an arm the SUBSCRIPTION arm is `RequestAuth.arm === "oauth"`, set by the credential half itself — never "the composite returned an artifact". `CompositeCredentialProvider` falls through to the api-key half, which ALWAYS returns an object (`{headers:{}}` even with no key), so a truthiness test on the cached artifact labels every metered request SUB and accrues $0. Absent `arm` ⇒ metered. This shipped once and three reviewers read it as correct.
- Providers whose uids collide with another vendor's namespace (`devin`, `qwen-cloud`) declare no `nativeModelPatterns` and no routing rule — explicit `provider@model` access only.
- `gk@` is the Grok SUBSCRIPTION; `grok@`/`xai@` is the metered `x-ai`. `moonshot-cn@` is a different service from `moonshot@`.
- A bare Claude name (`claude-opus-5`, `opus`, `internal`) must never reach `route()`: `native-anthropic` has no credential store, so the credential filter drops it and the chain degrades to OpenRouter. Check `nativeRouteFor()` (`providers/native-route.ts`) FIRST, as the proxy does — `preflight` and the TUI probe once didn't and told agents to drop their own subscription's models. Native routes also cannot be probed from outside a session (the handler forwards the inbound Claude Code header); report them as a third outcome, never as success or failure.
- A new `ClaudishProfileConfig` field MUST be added to `loadConfig`'s allowlist in `profile-config.ts`; otherwise it survives on disk until the first global save and is then dropped. Bit `onepasswordEnvironments`, then `keychain`.

## Commands

- `bun run build` — CLI and macOS bridge bundles. `bun run dev` — development mode.
- `bun run test` — full suite. `bun run test:safe` — same, guarded against touching the real config.
- `bun run typecheck`, `bun run lint`, `bun run format`
- `claudish --probe <model>` shows the adapter composition; `--debug` writes a log to `logs/`.
- Model syntax is `provider@model[:concurrency]` (`google@gemini-2.0-flash`, `ollama@llama3.2:3`); a bare name auto-routes by pattern. Prefix meanings: `routing.md`.

## Releasing

**CI/CD publishes — do NOT run `npm publish`.** `release.yml` fires on the `v*` tag push,
generates `CHANGELOG.md` with `git cliff`, and publishes over OIDC. It runs NO test suite, so
the tag is the gate: everything must be green before it leaves the machine.

Bump TWO files by hand — `package.json` and `packages/cli/package.json` (what npm publishes;
a stale value fails the publish) — then run
`bun run --cwd packages/cli scripts/generate-version.ts`. `packages/cli/src/version.ts` is
GENERATED from `packages/cli/package.json` and says so in its header; editing it by hand is
silently overwritten by the next `build`.

**Never `git push --tags`.** Local `v7.8.2` diverges from origin's, so `--tags` exits
non-zero on every release — after the new tag has already landed. It reports failure over
success, which is the one outcome an automated release cannot recover from. Push the
explicit ref, which touches nothing else:

```
git tag -a v9.2.0 -F <message-file> <merge-sha>   # -F, not -m: backticks in -m are command substitution
git push origin refs/tags/v9.2.0
```

Re-check `git ls-remote --tags origin refs/tags/vX.Y.Z` IMMEDIATELY before tagging, not once
at preflight — a concurrent release burns the number in that gap, and the losing rebase
silently drops the now-empty bump commit.

**From a worktree** you cannot `git checkout main` (the primary checkout holds it). Open a PR
and merge it, or `git push origin HEAD:main` after `git rebase origin/main`. Either way, tag
the MERGE COMMIT, never the branch head CI did not validate. After any rebase merge, verify
`git show origin/main:packages/cli/package.json | grep version` really carries your bump.

## Session artifacts

`ai-docs/` is TRACKED; `ai-docs/sessions/{task-slug}-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}-{hash}/` is GITIGNORED and
does not survive a fresh clone or `git worktree remove`. Work there — scratch notes, raw runs,
probe scripts — rather than `/tmp`, but put anything meant to outlive the session somewhere
tracked: `ai-docs/reports/` for findings, `ai-docs/benches/` for evals, `ai-docs/architecture/`
for rationale. Three write-ups already died this way.

## Learned Preferences

### Tools & Commands
<!-- learned: 2026-03-28 session: 03cd7cc5 source: repeated_pattern -->
- Use `bun` for all package management and scripts (`bun run build`, `bun test`, etc.) — not npm or yarn
<!-- learned: 2026-04-06 session: df311293 source: repeated_pattern -->
<!-- revised: 2026-07-26 — root cause was a missing Ollama embedding model, not mnemex itself -->
- Prefer mnemex AST lookups over grep for symbol/caller questions: `mnemex --agent symbol|callers|callees "Name"`
- Semantic search is `mnemex --agent search "concept"` — NOT `map`, which ignores its argument entirely and always dumps the same PageRank overview
- `search` needs Ollama serving `nomic-embed-text` — without it embeddings are zero-length, so search is useless and `status` panics with a lance divide-by-zero. Fix: `ollama pull nomic-embed-text` → `rm -rf .mnemex/vectors` → `mnemex index`

### Workflow
<!-- learned: 2026-04-06 session: df311293 source: explicit_rule -->
- Don't run claudish directly in main bash — use dedicated channel sessions or `/delegate`
<!-- learned: 2026-09-02 source: near_miss -->
- NEVER `git stash` from a worktree. The stash stack is shared with the main checkout and
  every sibling worktree, and concurrent sessions push and pop it. A bare push/pop pair is
  not symmetric: another session can push between yours, so your `pop` takes THEIR work and
  buries yours where nobody is looking. Both trees then look plausible and neither errors.
  Set work aside with a temporary WIP commit, or copy the file out and back. To revert a
  file for a mutation test, copy it — do not use git.
- Deep rationale goes in `ai-docs/architecture/`, not here. Add it there and name the trigger in the list above.
