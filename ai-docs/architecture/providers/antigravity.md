# Antigravity Provider (`ag@`) — Gemini via your Antigravity subscription

Two separate Gemini flows, deliberately split:

| Flow | Prefix | Auth | Backend | Billing |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Direct Gemini API | `g@` / `google@` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` | pay-per-use |
| **Antigravity** | `ag@` / `antigravity@` | your Antigravity OAuth token (shared with the `agy` CLI) | `daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal` | your Antigravity subscription (free / Pro / Ultra) |

**The `gemini-codeassist` provider was fully REMOVED (v7.36.0)** — definition, transport, credential provider, OAuth registration, quota adapter, probe entry, and the `--gemini-login`/`--gemini-logout` flags. It could not authenticate for any consumer account, yet it sat FIRST in the `gemini-*` routing chain, so every bare `gemini-*` name paid a guaranteed-failing round-trip before falling through to the metered `google` API — silently billing per-token for a model the user's subscription already covered. The chain is now `["antigravity", "google", "openrouter"]`, matching the subscription-first convention every other family already follows. A leftover `~/.claudish/gemini-oauth.json` no longer reads as a live credential (its `oauth-registry.ts` entries are gone), which is what kept a dead provider in the config TUI's Test All list.

The Antigravity half of the old `auth/gemini-oauth.ts` was extracted to **`auth/antigravity-user.ts`** (project/tier resolution, `retrieveUserQuota`, live served-set discovery) before that file was deleted — Antigravity depends on it, so deleting wholesale would have taken `ag@` down too. All three calls now share ONE identity (the Antigravity User-Agent). `retrieveUserQuota` used to keep the gemini-cli UA it was written with; measured 2026-08-18 on a real Ultra account, same token and project, only the UA varying — the gemini-cli UA returned 4 quota buckets (the retired free Code Assist served set) and the Antigravity UA returned 24. This backend gates its ANSWER on request identity, not just the tier label it displays.

**Why not just spoof the identity:** the backend has two independent gates. `loadCodeAssist` gates the visible *tier* on request identity (`User-Agent` + `metadata.ideType: ANTIGRAVITY`), but `streamGenerateContent` gates *generation* on the OAuth **client that minted the token** — headers can't fake it (403 PERMISSION_DENIED). So claudish does not spoof; it **reuses the user's own Antigravity token**.

## THE HOST IS NOT `cloudcode-pa` (v7.66.0)

`ag@` was built from the remains of the removed `gemini-codeassist` provider. The
token was swapped to Antigravity's; the HOST was kept, under a source comment
asserting *"the split was never about the URL, it was about which OAuth client
minted the token."* **That assertion was wrong**, and it cost a full debugging
session.

`cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` is **Code Assist's** backend — the product Google
retired for individuals. Antigravity's own backend is
`daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com`. Present an Antigravity token to the former
and you are answered *as Code Assist*.

Measured 2026-08-24 — one Google AI Ultra account, same token, same project, same
model, only the host varying:

```
cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com        generate gemini-3.6-flash-high -> 429
daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com  generate gemini-3.6-flash-high -> 200
```

On `cloudcode-pa` that account reads `currentTier: free-tier` (while `paidTier`
says `g1-ultra-tier`), is served a roster of `gemini-2.5-*` plus editor-internal
`chat_*`/`tab_*` ids, reports every quota bucket at 100% **forever** because
nothing is ever consumed, and can generate with EXACTLY the two `tab_*`
inline-completion models — free Code Assist's remaining entitlement — while all
28 chat models return a **contentless** `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`:

```json
{"error":{"code":429,"message":"Resource has been exhausted (e.g. check quota).",
          "status":"RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED"}}
```

No `details`, no `ErrorInfo`, no `RetryInfo`. It is not a rate limit; it is the
wrong product. Those two `200`s are what let nine wrong hypotheses survive — an
identity rejected everywhere tells you nothing, but one that succeeds on exactly
the completion models is naming its own tier out loud.

`agy` 1.1.18 has never called anything else: 2,822 requests across 73 log files
spanning a week, 100% to `daily-`, 0% to `cloudcode-pa`. Its log is the primary
source — `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/cli.log`, lines beginning `URL:`.

`AICODE_ENDPOINT_URL` overrides the host. It is the same variable `agy` reads, so
a user on a different release track can point claudish where their own CLI goes.

## `-tiered` means the tier is a PARAMETER, not part of the id

The Antigravity CLI shows "Gemini 3.7 Flash" with a low/medium/high **Effort**
slider. That is one model, not three: `gemini-3.7-flash-high` **404s**, and the
only served 3.7 id is `gemini-3.7-flash-tiered`. The response declares it:

```json
"tieredModelIds": {"flashLite":["gemini-3.1-flash-lite"],
                   "flash":["gemini-3.7-flash-tiered"],
                   "pro":["gemini-3.1-pro-low"]}
```

Gemini 3.6 still bakes the tier into the id (`-high`/`-low`/`-medium`); 3.7 moved
to the parameter form. **Both shapes are live at once.** Effort travels as
`generationConfig.thinkingConfig.thinkingLevel` (`low`/`medium`/`high`, all
verified 200), which `adapters/gemini-api-format.ts` already emits for any
`gemini-3*` id from Claude Code's own effort setting — so claudish has the Effort
slider already. `xhigh` and `max` both collapse to `high`, because Gemini 3 has
nothing above it.

**Do not read `agy models` output as API ids.** It is the CLI's DISPLAY
vocabulary. Doing so produced a bug report asking a backend to add five ids that
404 and delete the one that works.

## The roster: what the backend declares unselectable

`fetchAvailableModels` returns the whole editor surface, and states three ways
which of it is not a chat model — all of them read by
`getServedAntigravityModels`:

| Signal | Shape | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `isInternal: true` | per-model flag | `chat_20706`, `chat_23310` (both 400) |
| modality role lists | `tabModelIds`, `imageGenerationModelIds`, `audioTranscriptionModelIds` | `gemini-3.1-flash-image` |
| `deprecatedModelIds` | **map** id → `{newModelId}` | `gemini-3.1-pro-high` → `gemini-pro-agent` |

The deprecation map is load-bearing: `gemini-3.1-pro-high` is still present in
`models`, looks entirely ordinary, carries full capability flags — and answers
`400 INVALID_ARGUMENT`. The deprecation notice is the only warning given.

NOT excluded: `mqueryModelIds` / `webSearchModelIds` / `commitMessageModelIds`.
Those are role ASSIGNMENTS of an ordinary model — all three name
`gemini-3.1-flash-lite`, which chats fine. Treating a role as a disqualification
dropped a real model from the picker.

Only `tab_*` needs a prefix rule; it appears in no list and carries no flag.

## Ordering: catalog dates are poison for this roster

Antigravity rows set `ignoreCatalogReleaseDate`. `compareByReleaseDateDesc` sorts
undated rows last, and measured 2026-08-24 only 6 of 19 served ids had a catalog
date — every one of them an OLD base model, while every new variant had none:

```
dated    gemini-2.5-flash          2025-04-17     <- sorted to the TOP
UNDATED  gemini-3.7-flash-tiered          —       <- sorted to the BOTTOM
```

The catalog dates *base* models; Antigravity serves *variants* it does not list.
Six dated of nineteen was worse than zero: a partial signal ranked confidently on
incomplete evidence. Suppressed, the whole roster falls through to version-parts
and orders 3.7 > 3.6 > 3.5 > 3.1 > 3 > 2.5.


**Token lifecycle** (`auth/antigravity-token.ts`, macOS):
- **Shared store**: the same keychain item the `agy` CLI uses — `service=gemini, account=antigravity`, value `go-keyring-base64:<base64(JSON)>` (zalando/go-keyring). claudish reads AND writes it, so both tools reuse one live token.
- **Self-refresh**: when the token is expired, POST `oauth2/token` with `grant_type=refresh_token`. The Antigravity client_id/secret are **never shipped** — they're extracted at runtime from the user's own local `agy` binary (`strings` for the `…apps.googleusercontent.com` id + `GOCSPX-` secret; the working combo is discovered by first-200 and cached). The refreshed (and possibly rotated) token is written back to the shared store.
- **Degradation**: no store (agy not installed / not signed in) or non-macOS → actionable error pointing at `g@` + `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

**Model ids — LIVE discovery, no hardcoded map**: the Antigravity backend requires a reasoning-tier suffix (bare `gemini-3.6-flash` → 404), but which variants a subscription serves is **per-account and drifts**, so claudish never hardcodes a roster. `getServedAntigravityModels()` fetches the live set from the backend's own `v1internal:fetchAvailableModels` (body `{project}`) — the served ids are the response `models` keys, plus a backend `defaultAgentModelId` — cached with a TTL. `resolveAntigravityModelId(requested, servedIds, defaultId)` then resolves against that LIVE set: exact match passes through; a bare family (e.g. `gemini-3.6-flash`) resolves to the backend's `defaultAgentModelId` when it's a variant of that family, else to the strongest reasoning tier by a *rank rule* (`high>medium>low>extra-low>tiered` — a rule, like `rankCodeAssistModel`, not pinned ids); anything else passes through to the F1–F7 404 rewrite. The only literals are the tier-rank ordering and endpoint strings — no concrete model ids in source.

**Identity strings**: `User-Agent: antigravity/cli/<ver> (aidev_client; os_type=<platform>; arch=<arch>; auth_method=consumer)` + `metadata: { ideType: "ANTIGRAVITY" }`. The transport keeps all the F1–F7 improvements from the old codeassist path (terminal-error → 400 surfaced inline, served-set-aware 404 rewrite, `rankCodeAssistModel`).
