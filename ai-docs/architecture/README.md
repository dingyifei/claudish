# Architecture — engineering rationale

Why the code is shaped the way it is: what was measured, what it cost, and what breaks if you
change it. None of this is recoverable by reading the source, which is the test for whether
something belongs here.

Extracted from `CLAUDE.md` in v7.64.0. That file is prepended to every session, so it had grown
to 1,531 lines — 156 KB of prompt on every turn, most of it needed only when working in one
specific area. It now holds only the operational core — commands, release steps, and the
invariants that fail silently — plus a list naming which document covers what.

Tracked deliberately, like `ai-docs/reports/`. These started life in `CLAUDE.md` precisely
because `ai-docs/sessions/` is gitignored and does not survive `git worktree remove` — the way
three earlier write-ups this material cites were lost.

## Documents

| Document | What it covers | Read it before you… |
|---|---|---|
| [`routing.md`](routing.md) | The `provider@model` syntax, the full provider-prefix table, local models, `defaultProvider` semantics, `ModelCatalogResolver` vendor-prefix resolution, the DERIVED picker roster, and why subscription pricing is decided by billing rather than by `modelDiscovery` | change `DEFAULT_ROUTING_RULES`, `defaultProvider`, the picker, a catalog resolver, or `SUBSCRIPTION_PROVIDERS` |
| [`providers/devin.md`](providers/devin.md) | The only binary wire in the pipeline — Connect envelopes carrying protobuf, live uid resolution, errors that ride an HTTP 200, and the three wire facts that cost real money to get wrong | touch `providers/devin/`, the codec, or `dv@` model resolution |
| [`providers/grok-subscription.md`](providers/grok-subscription.md) | `gk@` on a SuperGrok / X Premium+ plan: RFC 8628 device flow, exact-scope matching, 6-hour token refresh with write-back, three mandatory client headers | touch `gk@`, `claudish login grok`, or its OAuth refresh |
| [`providers/antigravity.md`](providers/antigravity.md) | Gemini on an Antigravity subscription: the shared `agy` keychain token, runtime client-secret extraction, live served-set discovery | touch `ag@`, `auth/antigravity-*`, or the keychain token |
| [`providers/qwen-alibaba.md`](providers/qwen-alibaba.md) | One service, two consoles, three mutually-rejecting key+host silos — plus the two measurement traps (a PUBLIC roster endpoint, and a rule generalised from one key) | touch `qc@`/`qp@`, or assume anything about Alibaba's silos |
| [`custom-endpoints.md`](custom-endpoints.md) | User-defined `customEndpoints`: schema, `${VAR}` expansion, and `authScheme: "none"` for endpoints that take NO credential | change `customEndpoints`, `config-schema.ts`, or `authScheme` handling |
| [`predefined-endpoints.md`](predefined-endpoints.md) | The 25-vendor bundled catalog: credential-gated activation, the single registration seam, evidence tiers (all `probe`, none `live`), and the no-model-data rule | add a vendor to `providers/predefined-catalog.ts`, or change endpoint registration |
| [`onepassword.md`](onepassword.md) | SDK-only secret resolution, the FOUR causes of an identical denial error, the cross-process handshake lock, parent-side route pinning, and the config TUI tab | touch `providers/onepassword*.ts`, credential pre-hydration, or the 1Password TUI tab |
| [`keychain.md`](keychain.md) | The macOS Keychain backend: the 17ms-vs-28ms measurement that split presence from values, the two `security` behaviours that are traps (hex reads, a "secure" write that stores nothing and exits 0), and why no new `CredentialSource` member | touch `providers/keychain.ts`, `keychain-source.ts`, or the Providers tab's key write/delete |
| [`adapters.md`](adapters.md) | Layers 1–3 (FormatConverter / ModelTranslator / ProviderTransport), stream-parser selection, errors that ride an HTTP 200, and the `upstream_status` remap with its downstream readers | add a provider, model translator, or stream parser; or change error classification and retry |
| [`behavior-layer.md`](behavior-layer.md) | Layer 4, the harness-convention SUPERVISOR: the rule engine, the four hooks, the 115-call plan-mode measurement it was built on, and opt-in telemetry | write a `behavior/` rule, or change harness-conformance handling |
| [`headless-vs-interactive.md`](headless-vs-interactive.md) | Why `-p` is NOT interactive-without-a-TTY: `--agent` validation is SILENTLY skipped under `--input-format stream-json` (measured, exit 0, no stream frame, `result: success`), upstream closed it as not planned, and why magmux is in the dependency tree | drive Claude Code headlessly, add a child-spawn flag, or assume a headless run behaves like an interactive one |
| [`context-window.md`](context-window.md) | Why setting one env lever accomplishes nothing, why the status line reports the ENFORCED window, and local-model token accounting | change context-window resolution, the status line, or token accounting |
| [`theming.md`](theming.md) | One detected theme for every surface, and the module-load palette-snapshot bug class it keeps producing (found six times) | add a colored CLI line or TUI surface |
| [`mcp-channel.md`](mcp-channel.md) | The 12-tool MCP surface, the channel wire format, the client-side conditions gating channel rendering, and the `notifications/progress` keepalive | add or rename an MCP tool, or change channel notifications |
| [`team-capture.md`](team-capture.md) | Why exit 0 proves nothing under `claude -p`, and the stream-json recovery that stopped discarding real answers | change how `team` spawns children or classifies their output |
| [`team-lifecycle.md`](team-lifecycle.md) | Why nothing kills a slot on a timer, the measurement that removed the deadline, the non-blocking `run` contract, and the duplicate supervision still owed to `StreamJsonReducer` | add a deadline, change when `team` returns, or touch per-slot liveness |
| [`debugging.md`](debugging.md) | Debug logging, `CLAUDISH_UPSTREAM_ERROR_LOG`, raw SSE capture, and the failed-translation workflow | diagnose a model producing wrong, empty, or garbled output |
| [`testing.md`](testing.md) | The SSE-replay format-translation harness and how to add a regression test | add a format-translation regression test |

## Neighbours

- **`ai-docs/reports/`** — measurement evidence these documents cite (probe results, live runs, protocol specs).
- **`ai-docs/benches/`** — reusable evals.
- **`ai-docs/sessions/`** — GITIGNORED scratch space. Work there; put conclusions here or in `reports/`.
- **`docs/`** — the published, user-facing site. `docs/three-layer-architecture.md` is a fuller
  treatment of Layers 1–3 under different names (`APIFormat`/`ModelDialect`) and carries its own
  name-mapping section; [`adapters.md`](adapters.md) is the shorter operational view.
