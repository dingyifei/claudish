# Channel regression guard mutation proof

Every mutation below was applied directly to the implementation, run against its named guard, and then reversed with a second hand-written patch. No git checkout or stash operation was used.

| guard | mutation applied | observed failure | reverted+green |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | Restored the old non-absorbing exit verdict by assigning `verdict.state` after the child exit unless the prior state was only `cancelled`. | `Expected: "timeout"` / `Received: "completed"` at `expect(info.status).toBe("timeout")`. | Yes; shared G1/G2 test passed after reversal. |
| G2 | Emitted `"timeout"` as the channel event whenever `sessionStatus` was `"timeout"`. | Terminal wire assertion diff: expected `["failed"]`, received `["timeout"]`. | Yes; shared G1/G2 test passed after reversal. |
| G3 | Restored both module-load signal exit codes to `0`. | SIGTERM assertion diff: expected `code: 143`, received `code: 0`. | Yes; G3 passed after reversal. |
| G4 | Emptied `RESERVED_CHILD_FLAGS`. | `Expected pattern: /channel transport/`; function did not throw and returned `undefined`. | Yes; G4 passed after reversal. |
| G5 | Swapped spawn argv order to `--quiet --verbose`. | `expect(quietAt).toBeGreaterThan(verboseAt)`: expected `> 4`, received `3`. | Yes; G5 passed after reversal. |
| G6 | Appended every raw stdout chunk to scrollback before reduction, storing the delta firehose. | `Expected to contain: "ALPHA"`; received only repeated captured `{"type":"stream_event",..."content_block_delta"...}` lines after the 2,000-line cap evicted the assistant prose. | Yes; G6 passed after reversal. |
| G7 | Unconditionally called `proc.stdin.end()` immediately after spawn. | `waitUntil timed out` while waiting for the promptless session to reach a usable `running` state. | Yes; G7 passed after reversal. |
| G1 contract rewrite | Narrowed the prior-terminal guard to `cancelled` and restored the historical exit-verdict overwrite, so exit 0 upgraded a recorded timeout to completed. | `Expected: "timeout"` / `Received: "completed"` at `expect(info.status).toBe("timeout")`. | Yes; rewritten G1/G2 passed after a hand-written reversal. |
| G2 contract rewrite | Restored the old split verdict by emitting `failed` from the reducer and retaining `timeout` only in `SessionInfo.status`. | Terminal wire assertion diff: expected `["timeout"]`, received `["failed"]`. | Yes; rewritten G1/G2 passed after a hand-written reversal. |
| SEP-1686 timeout map | Deleted `["timeout", "failed"]` from `EVENT_TO_TASK_STATUS`. | Behavioural guard failed at `mapEventToTaskStatus("timeout")`: expected `"failed"`, received `"working"`. | Yes; focused mapper guard passed after a hand-written reversal. |
