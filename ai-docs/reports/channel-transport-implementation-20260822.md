# Channel sessions → bidirectional stream-json — implementation log

Design implemented: `ai-docs/sessions/dev-arch-20260822-114706-c77bb53d/alternatives.md`,
Alternative A, phases 1 and 2 (phase 3 is `mcp-server.ts`, forbidden this batch).
Verified against `claude` 2.1.239 on this machine, 2026-08-22.

## 1. Files changed

| File | Why |
|---|---|
| `packages/cli/src/channel/stream-json-reducer.ts` | **NEW** (~470 ll). Replaces `SignalWatcher`. NDJSON → state, prose, accounting. Explicit transition table with absorbing terminal states; deltas consumed for liveness then discarded; per-line degradation; `result` frame drives turns/tokens/`terminal_reason`. |
| `packages/cli/src/channel/session-manager.ts` | Rewritten around the new transport: new argv, stdin held open, prompt as the first `user` frame, `send_input` writes a `user` frame, `CLAUDISH_TOKEN_FILE` in the child env, exit classified via `classifyRunOutput`, `"timeout"` survives in `SessionInfo.status`, reserved-flag rejection, `dispose()` actually called, `getDiagnostics()`. |
| `packages/cli/src/channel/types.ts` | `SignalState/SignalData/SignalCallback` → `ChannelEventType/ReducerEvent/ReducerCallback`. `ChannelEventType = Exclude<SessionStatus,"timeout">` encodes the `EVENT_TO_TASK_STATUS` constraint in the type system. `SessionInfo` gains `costUsd`, `toolCallCount`, `terminalReason`, `claudeSessionId`. |
| `packages/cli/src/channel/index.ts` | Export surface follows the rename; adds `buildChannelSpawnArgs`, `assertNoReservedFlags`, `userFrame`. |
| `packages/cli/src/channel/test-helpers/channel-diagnostic.ts` | One stale `SignalWatcher` mention in a diagnostic string. |
| `packages/cli/src/claude-runner.ts` | Signal handler exits `128 + signum` instead of `0`. Cleanup (temp settings unlink, `onCleanup`, `proc.kill`) unchanged. |
| `packages/cli/src/stats-buffer.ts` | **Not in the design.** A second, EARLIER-registered `process.exit(0)` signal handler — see §4.1. Now exits 143/130. |
| `packages/cli/src/team-stats.ts` | Adds `readTokenStatsAt(path)` (path-addressed); `readTokenStats` delegates. Adds `tool_calls` to `ModelTokenStats`. |
| `packages/cli/src/team-stream-capture.ts` | `STREAM_JSON_EVENT_TYPES` exported so the reducer can gate on the capture's real vocabulary instead of duplicating it. No behaviour change. |
| `ai-docs/architecture/mcp-channel.md` | Components, the exact argv and its three load-bearing properties, delta discipline, the timeout/wire split, session shape, test-file status. |

### Files deleted

- `packages/cli/src/channel/signal-watcher.ts` — the `⏺` `TOOL_PATTERNS`, the
  `QUESTION_PATTERNS`, the 2-second quiet-period `waiting_for_input` heuristic, and the
  `processExited` guard that only blocked `cancelled`. Nothing imports it.
- `packages/cli/src/channel/signal-watcher.test.ts` — 12 tests for the deleted module.

Nothing outside `packages/cli/src/channel/` was deleted.

## 2. The exact final argv

`SessionManager` spawns:

```
claudish --model <spawnModel|model> -y --verbose --quiet -p \
         --output-format stream-json \
         --input-format stream-json \
         --include-partial-messages \
         --include-hook-events \
         --replay-user-messages \
         --session-id <minted uuid> \
         [caller claudishFlags…]
```

Measured, not assumed — `claude` receives (probe `probes/probe-argv.ts`, real claudish tree,
`CLAUDE_PATH` pointed at a recording stand-in):

```
--settings /Users/jack/.claudish/settings-….json --dangerously-skip-permissions
-p --output-format stream-json --input-format stream-json --include-partial-messages
--include-hook-events --replay-user-messages --session-id <uuid> --verbose
```

Order rationale, all three verified:

1. `--verbose` BEFORE `--quiet` — claudish consumes `--verbose` itself (`cli.ts:344`,
   sets `quiet=false`) and separately forwards a copy to `claude` (`cli.ts:674`), which
   hard-errors on `--print --output-format stream-json` without it. Reversed, every child
   narrates onto stderr. Mirrors `team-orchestrator.ts:818-825`.
2. `-p` present and followed by a flag — without `-p` and without `--stdin`, `cli.ts:667`
   flips `interactive = true` and launches the picker; and the passthrough value rule
   (`cli.ts:647`) would swallow a following non-flag token.
3. `--session-id <uuid>` last of the base args — it consumes exactly one token, so caller
   flags appended after it are parsed fresh.

### `--stdin` removal — VERIFIED, not assumed

The task flagged this as the thing to confirm. Probe result (`probes/probe-argv.ts`):

- claudish stays non-interactive (no picker), because `-p` sets `_hasPrintFlag`.
- `readStdin()` never runs, so nothing in claudish consumes fd 0.
- A `{"type":"user",…}` frame written to the spawned process's stdin arrived at the
  grandchild's fd 0 **byte-identical**, and the grandchild's stdout arrived back on the
  parent's pipe. Zero relay code — `stdio: "inherit"` all the way down.
- Parent stderr was empty (`--quiet` won claudish's own verbosity), exit 0.

---

## 3. Behaviour changes worth knowing

### 3.1 Session shape now follows the prompt (a design gap I had to close)

The design says `result` → `waiting_for_input` and stdin stays open. It never says when a
session reaches `completed`. Taken literally, **no session would ever complete**: the child
answers, sits idle, and the 600 s timeout reports a failure it did not have. Since
`create_session`'s schema lives in `mcp-server.ts` (forbidden), no new tool parameter was
available, so the signal had to come from existing information:

- `prompt` **given** → one-shot. First `result` closes stdin; the child exits 0; state
  becomes `completed`. Event sequence: `running → tool_executing → running →
  waiting_for_input → completed`.
- `prompt` **absent** → interactive. Stdin stays open forever, `waiting_for_input` between
  turns, ends on `cancel_session` or the timeout.
- Any `send_input` converts a one-shot session to interactive — the caller has taken over.

This also resolves Phase 1 item 5 (the promptless hang) *architecturally* rather than with
the `stdin.end()` the design proposed: that fix only made sense while `--stdin` existed. With
`--stdin` gone, `readStdin` never runs, there is no drain to satisfy, and a promptless
session is a legitimately-waiting session that `send_input` can now actually drive. Adding
`stdin.end()` here would have re-broken the documented "send later" workflow.

### 3.2 `get_output` returns prose, and now explains failures

`output` is recovered assistant prose (`createAssistantTextCapture`, reused verbatim), which
is strictly more than the old final-message-only text. Raw NDJSON never reaches it. On a
FAILED session the classifier's explanation plus the meaningful stderr tail is appended as a
`[claudish] …` block — so the diagnostic that used to sit unreachable in `stderr.log` is now
in the field the agent reads. No wire-shape change; the JSON keys are identical.

### 3.3 On-disk artifacts

`prompt.md`, `output.log` (prose, no longer 0 B), `stderr.log`, `meta.json` (now with
`costUsd`/`toolCallCount`/`terminalReason`/`claudeSessionId`), plus two new ones:
`events.jsonl` (every semantic frame, deltas excluded — ~2 KB for a short session, ~1.3 MB
for a long one) and `tokens.json` (the child's own token tracker output).

### 3.4 Cost is deliberately NOT taken from the child

`result.total_cost_usd` prices every model at Anthropic's rates. For a proxied model that is
fiction, and for a subscription provider it invents spend that will never be billed —
directly against the `SUBSCRIPTION_PROVIDERS` invariant in `CLAUDE.md`. `costUsd` therefore
comes only from the proxy's token file, and is `0` when that file does not exist. Tokens fall
back to `result.usage` when the file is absent; turns come only from `result.num_turns`.

### 3.5 `dispose()` — the leak

There were zero call sites. Now: on child exit, on spawn error, and for every session in
`shutdownAll()` (whether or not its process is still alive), alongside `clearTimeout` of both
handles. The timeout handle and kill handle are `unref()`d so a pending session timer can
never hold the MCP server open.

### 3.6 Stall watchdog

Deltas reset a liveness clock; after 120 s of total silence in `starting` or `running` the
session emits ONE `running` event with `meta.stalled=true` and the idle seconds.
`tool_executing` and `waiting_for_input` are exempt — a 10-minute `Bash` and a session waiting
for input are both legitimately silent. It reports; it never terminates. Configurable via
`SessionManagerOptions.stallSeconds` (0 disables).

### 3.7 Reserved flags (from the coordinator's mid-task correction)

`assertNoReservedFlags` rejects a caller-supplied `-p`, `--print`, `--output-format`,
`--input-format`, `--session-id`, `--verbose` with a named error. Local to
`session-manager.ts`, not in the shared `buildChildClaudeFlags` — the reserved set is a
property of this transport and team reserves fewer. `--flag=value` spellings are handled.
Verified: `--verbose` and `--output-format json` rejected, `--agent dev:reviewer` accepted.

---

## 4. Things the design got wrong, or did not know

### 4.1 `claude-runner.ts:1608` is NOT the only `process.exit(0)` — and it is not the one that fires

The design names that line as "the single line that manufactures the false success". It is
not. `packages/cli/src/stats-buffer.ts:225` registers `process.on("SIGTERM", … process.exit(0))`
**at module load**, i.e. long before `setupSignalHandlers` runs, and it exits unconditionally.

Measured after fixing `claude-runner.ts` alone: a group SIGTERM against a live channel child
still produced `code=0, signal=null`. After also fixing `stats-buffer.ts`: `code=143`.

`stats-buffer.ts` is outside `packages/cli/src/channel/` but is not on the forbidden list, and
fixing it is Phase 1 item 1's actual intent. It has a SIGINT twin, now `130`.

**Anyone re-deriving this bug from the design will fix the wrong line and see no change.**

### 4.2 `createAssistantTextCapture` cannot be fed the raw stream

The design says reuse it "verbatim" for the answer. Its degradation rule passes through any
line whose `type` it does not recognise, and its vocabulary is exactly
`{system, assistant, user, result}`. So feeding it the real stream puts **every
`stream_event` delta and every `rate_limit_event` into the answer as raw JSON**. Observed:
the first probe run had a `rate_limit_event` frame sitting in `get_output`.

Fix: the reducer gates. Deltas never reach it (rule 1 anyway); a JSON line whose `type` is
outside the capture's vocabulary goes to `events.jsonl` only. Non-JSON lines still pass
through verbatim, which preserves the degradation guarantee — the worst case stays an ugly
answer, never a lost one. `STREAM_JSON_EVENT_TYPES` is now exported so the two cannot drift.

### 4.3 A non-JSON line really does appear mid-stream

`claude 2.1.239` emitted, on stdout, between frames:

```
Client.listTools() called but server does not advertise tools capability - returning empty list
```

The per-line degradation rule is load-bearing, not defensive padding. It is recorded as an
anomaly and kept in the prose.

### 4.4 `--agent` under `--input-format stream-json`

Ran the control the coordinator asked for. The result is **not** the clean "still errors"
the request expected, and not the "silently dropped" it feared:

| invocation | outcome |
|---|---|
| `claude -p "say hi" --agent zzz-not-a-real-agent` | exit 1, stderr `--agent 'zzz-not-a-real-agent' not found. Available agents: …` |
| same, with `--output-format stream-json --input-format stream-json` + a frame on stdin | **exit 0, normal answer.** No error at all. |
| `--agent Explore` with a positional prompt | `system:init.tools` = 157, no `Edit`/`Write`/`Task` |
| `--agent Explore` with `--input-format stream-json` | same non-MCP tool set, no `Edit`/`Write`/`Task` |

So: **a VALID `--agent` IS honoured under `--input-format stream-json`. An INVALID one is
silently ignored and falls back to the default agent, instead of the exit-1 "not found" that
print mode gives.** The channel path is therefore functional but has lost its typo guard —
`create_session(agent: "dev:reviwer")` will quietly run the default agent. Worth a
client-side check in `create_session` (mcp-server.ts, not my file).

### 4.5 §1.1's `readStdin` hang

Correct as written, and it disappears with `--stdin`. See §3.1.

---

## 5. What I could not verify

1. **JSON-parse cost at 20 concurrent sessions.** Single sessions only, as in the design.
   No `setImmediate` yield was added — it would be speculative. The delta path is one
   `JSON.parse` plus a `Set.has`, and deltas never touch the capture, the scrollback or the
   disk, which is the cheapest shape available without measuring.
2. **A real long session with `--include-partial-messages` end to end.** Every probe used a
   `CLAUDE_PATH` stand-in or a single short real `claude` turn. The 5–14 MB delta volume is
   the design's estimate, not something I reproduced. What IS verified is that deltas are
   dropped before any buffer.
3. **`--session-id` collision behaviour.** The uuid is minted per session with `randomUUID()`;
   I did not test what `claude` does if one is reused.
4. **The transcript path.** `claudeSessionId` is recorded (from `system:init`, cross-checked
   against the minted uuid) but no code resolves it to a file. Doing so needs the realpath
   slug fix the design flags at §3.1/§7.9, and its only consumer is Phase 3's
   `get_diagnostics` in `mcp-server.ts`.
5. **The stall watchdog against a genuinely wedged real model.** Exercised only with
   `stallSeconds: 0` (disabled) in the probes.

---

## 6. Test status — READ THIS

I wrote no tests, per instruction. Current state, `CLAUDISH_SKIP_LIVE_E2E=1`:

- Full suite: **2816 pass, 12 skip, 12 fail** over 2840 tests.
- 11 of those 12 are `src/channel/session-manager.test.ts` (12 of its 23 tests fail).
  They assert the pre-stream-json topology: the `--stdin` argv, exit-0-means-completed, and
  a `fake-claudish.ts` shim that echoes stdin instead of speaking stream-json. Every one is
  an intended contract change, not a regression.
- The 12th, `team-timeout-repro.test.ts › REPRO: process that completes just before timeout`,
  **passes in isolation** (8/8) and fails only in the contended full run — the documented
  `project_test_contention_false_failures` flake.
- `channel-wire-format.test.ts` (6) and `scrollback-buffer.test.ts` (11) both pass: **the
  channel wire contract is intact.**
- `team-stats`, `team-stream-capture`, `stats-buffer`, `session/`, `process-tree`,
  `status-line-context`: 123/123 pass.

Failing tests, verbatim:

```
SessionManager > spawn argv falls back to the requested model when spawnModel is absent
SessionManager > spawnModel changes argv while SessionInfo keeps the requested model
SessionManager > getOutput returns output from process stdout
SessionManager > getOutput totalLines reflects number of lines produced
SessionManager > getOutput with tail_lines returns only the last N lines
SessionManager > listSessions excludes completed sessions when includeCompleted=false
SessionManager > listSessions includes completed sessions when includeCompleted=true
SessionManager > meta.json is written to the configured sessions directory after completion
SessionManager > onStateChange callback fires with session_id and event
SessionManager > sendInput returns false for completed session
SessionManager > cancelSession returns false for completed session
SessionManager > timeout kills long-running process and terminates it
```

The test-architect will need `fake-claudish.ts` to emit stream-json frames (a working model
is `probes/fake-claude-streaming.mjs` and `probes/fake-claude-modes.mjs` here) and to assert
the new argv from `buildChannelSpawnArgs`, which is exported for exactly that.

---

## 7. Verification runs

`bun run typecheck` — clean, both packages, no output.
`bun run lint` — **exit 0**, 0 errors, 881 warnings (all pre-existing `noExplicitAny` /
`noExcessiveCognitiveComplexity`; none in the new files).
`bun run build` — CLI 2.78 MB, bridge 3.15 MB, both bundle.

### Probes (all in `probes/`, all runnable)

| probe | what it proved |
|---|---|
| `probe-argv.ts` + `fake-claude.mjs` | the argv survives claudish's parser; stdin reaches the grandchild; stdout comes back; stderr silent; exit 0 |
| `probe-session-manager.ts` + `fake-claude-streaming.mjs` | full one-shot: `running → tool_executing → running → waiting_for_input → completed`, prose recovered (no protocol JSON), `turnsCompleted: 1`, `tokensUsed: 1290`, `toolCallCount: 1`, `terminalReason: "completed"`, `claudeSessionId` from `system:init`, honest `meta.json`, non-empty `output.log`, 2 KB `events.jsonl` |
| `probe-failures.ts` + `fake-claude-modes.mjs` | the four honesty cases, below |

Failure-path results:

```
[1 silent-zero]  status=failed  exit=0    events=failed
                 output carries "[claudish] Child exited 0 without ever emitting a terminal
                 `result` frame … stderr: [claude-code:unrecognized_model] {"model":"cx@gpt-5.6-sol"…
[2 timeout    ]  status=timeout exit=143  events=failed   meta.status=timeout
[3 cancel     ]  status=cancelled exit=143 events=cancelled
[4 interactive]  send#1=true send#2=true  turns=2  output="turn1:ALPHA\n\n\nturn2:BETA"
[5 flags      ]  --verbose → rejected; --output-format json → rejected; --agent dev:reviewer → accepted
```

Case 1 is the original bug, byte for byte — the same `unrecognized_model` stderr line, the
same exit 0, the same empty stdout. It now reports `failed` and hands the agent the
diagnostic. Case 2 is the clobber: `SessionInfo.status` and `meta.json` both say `"timeout"`
while the wire event stays `"failed"`, and the child's exit does not upgrade it. Case 4 is
`send_input` working for the first time.

---

## 8. Not done (Phase 3, all in the forbidden `mcp-server.ts`)

- `get_diagnostics` MCP tool. `SessionManager.getDiagnostics()` exists and returns the
  stderr tail, anomalies, `events.jsonl` path, `claudeSessionId`, terminal reason and
  accounting — it needs ~20 lines of tool registration and nothing else.
- `["timeout","failed"]` in `EVENT_TO_TASK_STATUS`. Until it lands, `ChannelEventType`
  excludes `"timeout"` and there is a `TODO(phase3)` on the type saying so.
- `CLAUDISH_UPSTREAM_ERROR_LOG` per session.
- A client-side agent-name check in `create_session` (see §4.4).

---

# Review fixes (3/3 REJECT → nine defects)

Review inputs: `ai-docs/sessions/review-impl-20260822-130838/response-{01,02,05}.md`.
Every fix below is proven by a probe in `probes/probe-review-fixes.ts` (D1–D8) or
`probes/probe-shutdown-orphan.ts` (D9), and every probe is proven to be load-bearing by a
hand-written mutation applied and reversed with `probes/mutate.ts` — no `git checkout`, no
stash. Verbatim probe output is in §V below.

**No test file was edited.** `session-manager.test.ts`, `test-helpers/*`, `mcp-server.ts`,
`cli.ts`, `team-orchestrator.ts`, `providers/claude-code-aliases.*` and
`mcp-child-flags.test.ts` are untouched. G1–G7 are still green.

## D1 — exit-before-drain race (BLOCKING) — FIXED

`proc.on("exit")` no longer finalises. `handleExit` records only
`{code, signal, at}` into `entry.pendingExit`; the new `finalize()` runs when BOTH stdio
pipes have emitted `close` (`onPipeClosed`, counting down `entry.openPipes`) or after
`DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS` — imported from `team-orchestrator.ts`, the same 10 s bound and the same
rationale as `team`'s own exit handler, which the new comment at the site cites by line.

`exit` fires before the stdout pipe closes and the `result` frame is by construction the
LAST line the child writes, so it is exactly the frame in flight at that moment. A `close`
that arrives before `exit` is handled too (`onPipeClosed` returns until `pendingExit` is
set). `finalize()` is idempotent (`entry.finalized`) and is the single funnel for all four
endings: pipes drained, drain timeout, spawn error, `shutdownAll`.

Measured — probe emits `exit` first, then the answer + `result`:

| | status | output | meta.json |
|---|---|---|---|
| pre-fix (mutation D1) | `failed` | diagnostic only | `failed` |
| fixed | `completed` | contains `FINAL ANSWER` | `completed` |

## D2 — RESERVED_CHILD_FLAGS incomplete (BLOCKING) — FIXED

The hand-written list is gone. `RESERVED_CHILD_FLAGS` is now DERIVED from
`buildChannelSpawnArgs` — every token in the base argv that starts with `-` — plus
`RESERVED_FLAG_ALIASES` and `TRANSPORT_BREAKING_FLAGS` (`--stdin`). Anything added to the
spawn argv is reserved automatically; that drift is what produced the hole.

Aliases were read out of `cli.ts`'s arg loop, not guessed: `--model`/`-m` (:263),
`--auto-approve`/`-y` (:310), `--quiet`/`-q` (:338), `--verbose`/`-v` (:340), plus
`-p`→`--print` (a `claude` flag, not a claudish one).

Effective set (18): `--model -m -y --auto-approve --verbose -v --quiet -q -p --print
--output-format --input-format --include-partial-messages --include-hook-events
--replay-user-messages --session-id --stdin`.

**The matcher was deliberately NOT widened.** Exact-token equality, with the existing
long-form `=value` split, is kept. A `startsWith` matcher would reject `--print-argv`
(used by two existing tests, and the flag that pins the argv-ordering invariant),
`--model-opus`, `--model-sonnet` and `--agents` — the too-wide half of the mistake
`buildChildClaudeFlags` shipped. Mutation `D2w` reproduces exactly that: three false
rejections. `-v=x` handling was NOT added — `cli.ts` accepts no such spelling.

Verified: all 18 rejected, `--print-argv --model-opus --model-sonnet --agents --effort`
accepted, G4 green, and `team-orchestrator.test.ts -t "pinned spawn identity"` 2 pass/0 fail.

## D3 — stale result witness (BLOCKING) — FIXED

`StreamJsonReducer.beginTurn()` clears `_resultSeen` / `_resultIsError` /
`_apiErrorStatus`, and `writeFrame` calls it on every frame written to the child's stdin —
the one moment we know for certain a new turn is outstanding. Cumulative accounting
(`_turns`, tokens, `_terminalReason`) is deliberately untouched: it is history, not
completion evidence.

Also: `_resultIsError` now also latches on a `subtype` beginning with `error`
(`error_max_turns`, `error_during_execution`), which `is_error` alone did not always carry.

Probe: promptless session → turn 1 answers with a clean `result` → `send_input` turn 2 →
child exits 0 mid-turn. Pre-fix `completed`; fixed `failed`, with the diagnostic naming the
missing `result` frame.

**Partially disputed.** gpt-5.6-sol also asked that `classifyExit` require
`terminalReason === "completed"`. I did not do that and think it would be a regression:
the `terminal_reason` vocabulary is UNMEASURED here (the implementation log's own probes
only ever observed `"completed"`), the field is optional on the wire, and a Claude Code
version that omits it would turn every successful session into a failure. The
turn-scoping above closes the actual reported failure mode; a value-level check needs a
measured vocabulary first.

## D4 — raw event logs persist secrets, unbounded (SECURITY) — FIXED

`onSemanticLine` now routes through `appendEventLog`, which `redactSecrets(line)`s each
frame (imported from `../redact.js`, the module `team-orchestrator.ts` itself imports —
that file was not touched) and stops at `EVENT_LOG_LIMIT = 4 MB`, writing one
`{"type":"claudish_truncated","limit_bytes":…}` marker at the cut. `stderr.log` is
redacted at write time too, matching `team-orchestrator.ts:1070`.

Probe: an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-…` inside a `tool_result` frame and on stderr.
Pre-fix both files contained the key verbatim; fixed, neither does, `REDACTED` appears, and
5 MB of frames produce a 4.2 MB capped log carrying the truncation marker.

## D5 — UTF-8 corruption at chunk boundaries — FIXED

`node:string_decoder` `StringDecoder`, one per pipe, held on the entry; `decodeChunk()`
passes strings through (a test can `emit("data", "…")`, and `StringDecoder.write` only
accepts a Buffer). `finalize()` flushes `decoder.end()` on both before the reducer's own
`end()`.

Probe splits `日本語のテキスト 🚀 done` mid-codepoint across two chunks. Pre-fix:
`"���本語…"`. Fixed: byte-exact, no U+FFFD.

## D6 — batchToolUse timer does not cancel on state transition — FIXED

Two independent guards, both kept:
1. `transition()` calls `resetToolBatch()` on any real move where `newState !==
   "tool_executing"` — the timer never outlives the state it describes.
2. The timer callback re-checks `!disposed && _state === "tool_executing"`, covering the
   ordering where it was already queued on the macrotask queue when the move happened.

`clearBatchTimer` became `resetToolBatch` (timer + count + name), used by `settle` and
`dispose` too.

Either guard alone suppresses the defect, so the mutation proof needed BOTH removed:
with `D6`+`D6b` applied, gemini-3.7-flash's exact scenario (Read → tool_result → Write →
tool_result → 450 ms) yanks the session from `running` back to `tool_executing` and emits a
phantom notification. Fixed, it stays `running`.

**Also fixed here (glm-5.3 minor c):** `_toolUseCount` counted assistant FRAMES containing a
tool_use, not tool_use BLOCKS, so parallel calls — Claude Code's default shape — undercounted
the very metric ("93 tool calls") the incident was measured by. `toolUseNames()` returns
every block; `toolBatchAnnounced` stops the debounced notification repeating news the
immediate one already carried.

## D7 — spawn-error path leaks and writes no meta.json — FIXED

`proc.on("error")` now sets `pendingExit`, settles `failed`, records the reason into the
scrollback (so `get_output` explains it) and calls `finalize()` — which clears both timers,
ends `outputLogStream`, and writes `stderr.log` + `meta.json`.

This matters more than the review knew: measured under Bun, an ENOENT spawn emits
`error` + `close` and **no `exit` at all**, so nothing else was ever going to run.
(My first mutation of this path failed to reproduce because it left `pendingExit` set and
the pipe-close path finished the job; the corrected mutation restores the original handler
verbatim and does reproduce.)

Pre-fix: no `meta.json`, `outputLogStream` still open. Fixed: `meta.json` with
`status: "failed"`, stream nulled.

## D8 — unbounded entry.stderr, no session eviction — FIXED

- **stderr**: `recordStderr()` keeps `STDERR_SIDE_LIMIT` (32 KB) of HEAD **and** 32 KB of
  TAIL with one marker between. Both ends deliberately — the diagnostic that motivated this
  whole change (`[claude-code:unrecognized_model]`, 81 bytes) is emitted at STARTUP, so a
  pure tail buffer is precisely the shape that would have lost it. 2.6 MB written → 65 592
  chars held, with both `HEAD-MARKER` and `TAIL-MARKER` present.
- **eviction**: `scheduleEviction()` drops a terminal session from the map after
  `terminalRetentionMs` (default 30 min, `unref`'d, exposed on `SessionManagerOptions` for
  tests), and `evictOldestTerminal()` enforces a hard ceiling of 50 retained, oldest
  `completedAt` first. On-disk artifacts are untouched. There was previously not one
  `sessions.delete` in the file.

## D9 — shutdownAll cancels the SIGKILL fallback — FIXED

Rewritten around `terminateChildTree` (`process-tree.ts`): SIGTERM to the group, wait,
SIGKILL to the group, wait. Two separate bugs closed:

1. Liveness was `!proc.killed`. `signalProcessTree` sets `killed` the instant a signal is
   SENT, so a child that IGNORED SIGTERM — the only kind that needs escalating — read as
   already dead and was skipped. Now `exitCode === null && signalCode === null`. The same
   correction was applied to the timeout handler and `cancelSession`.
2. `entry.killHandle` (the SIGKILL a `cancel_session` scheduled 5 s earlier) was cleared
   for those skipped sessions, cancelling the only escalation. It is now cleared only
   AFTER `terminateChildTree` has actually run.

Also: a non-terminal session is settled `cancelled` BEFORE its reducer is disposed, then
`finalize`d — glm-5.3's minor (b), where the later exit found a disposed reducer and wrote
a `meta.json` still claiming the session was running.

Probe uses a real tree: a child that `trap`s SIGTERM holding a `/bin/sh` grandchild that
also hard-ignores it. `cancel_session`, then `shutdownAll` INSIDE the 5 s window.
Pre-fix (mutation D9): both child and grandchild survive. Fixed: both dead.

## Not done, deliberately

- **`terminalReason === "completed"` as a completion requirement** — disputed above (D3).
- **glm-5.3 minor (d), a second `result` with no intervening `user` frame is a swallowed
  self-transition.** Adding `repeat: true` at `applyResultFrame`'s transition would surface
  it, but it also emits a wire frame for every duplicate `result` in any state, and this
  transport only ever produces one `result` per input frame. Left alone rather than trading
  a silent edge case for guaranteed wire noise; worth revisiting if a real stream ever
  shows back-to-back results.

### Mutation proof

Applied with `bun run probes/mutate.ts <id> apply`, reversed with `… revert`. Every
reversal is verified by the anchor check in the script (it exits 2 if the file is not in
the expected state), and the full channel suite is green afterwards.

| mutation | what it restores | observed failure |
|---|---|---|
| `D1` | classify on `exit`, no drain | D1 ×3 — `status=failed`, answer tail lost, `meta.status=failed` |
| `D2` | the hand-listed reserved set | D2 ×11 — `-v`, `-m`, `--model`, `--stdin`, `-q`, `--quiet`, `-y`, `--auto-approve`, the three include/replay flags all ACCEPTED |
| `D2w` | a `startsWith` matcher "to catch aliases" | D2 ×3 — `--print-argv`, `--model-opus`, `--model-sonnet` falsely REJECTED |
| `D3` | session-global result witness | D3 ×2 — turn 2's silent death reported `completed` |
| `D4` | raw `events.jsonl` | D4 ×2 — the `sk-ant-…` key on disk verbatim |
| `D4b` | raw `stderr.log` | D4 ×1 — same key in `stderr.log` |
| `D5` | `chunk.toString("utf-8")` | D5 ×2 — `"���本語のテキスト 🚀 done"` |
| `D6` + `D6b` | timer with no state guard and no reset on transition | D6 ×2 — `running` → `tool_executing`, phantom notification (either guard alone suppresses it, so both are needed to reproduce) |
| `D7` | the original `settle` + `dispose` error handler | D7 ×2 — no `meta.json`, `outputLogStream` leaked |
| `D8` | `entry.stderr += chunk` | D8 ×1 — 2 621 465 chars held |
| `D8b` | no `sessions.delete` | D8 ×1 — 1 session retained past its window |
| `D9` | `!proc.killed` liveness + cleared escalation | D9 ×2 — child AND grandchild survive `shutdownAll` |

# Phase 3 — diagnostics as API

`mcp-server.ts` was released by the concurrent session at `471bbf7`, so the three items
§8 listed as blocked are now done, plus the one it did not list (`transcriptPath`).

## 1. Files changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `packages/cli/src/mcp-server.ts` | `["timeout","failed"]` in `EVENT_TO_TASK_STATUS`; the `get_diagnostics` tool, appended last; the terminal-failure notification hint now covers `timeout` and names `get_diagnostics`; `INSTRUCTIONS` documents the `timeout` event and step 5 of the workflow |
| `packages/cli/src/channel/types.ts` | `ChannelEventType = SessionStatus` (the `TODO(phase3)` is discharged); `ReducerEvent.sessionStatus` DELETED; `SessionInfo` gains `spawnModel` and `transcriptPath` |
| `packages/cli/src/channel/stream-json-reducer.ts` | `TERMINAL_STATES` and `LEGAL_TRANSITIONS` gain an absorbing `timeout` row; `settle()` drops the `sessionStatus` override; `onSemanticLine(line, label)` carries `type:subtype` so the ring need not re-parse |
| `packages/cli/src/channel/session-manager.ts` | `CLAUDISH_UPSTREAM_ERROR_LOG` in the child env; `getDiagnostics` rewritten (returns `SessionDiagnostics`); `stderrForDiagnostics`; the event ring (`recordEvent`); `readTailLines`; `recordNote` split out of `recordProse`; `refreshTranscriptPath`; the timeout path settles `"timeout"` |
| `packages/cli/src/session/session-discovery.ts` | `transcriptPathFor(cwd, uuid)` — the repo's ONLY `realpathSync` |
| `packages/cli/src/handlers/shared/upstream-error-capture.ts` | `redactSecrets` at write time, before truncation |
| `packages/cli/src/channel/index.ts` | exports `SessionDiagnostics`, `DiagnosticEvent` |
| `ai-docs/architecture/mcp-channel.md` | the timeout/wire convergence, the three diagnostics sections, the 13-tool roster, the double roster pin |

No test file and no `test-helpers/*` file was touched. `team-stream-capture.ts` is untouched
(the other session's `rate_limit_event` addition stands).

## 2. I DID widen the wire event. Why, and what it cost

The sequencing worked: with `["timeout","failed"]` present, `"timeout"` on the wire is
strictly better than the `"failed"` it replaces, and the ONE risk the TODO named is gone.
The remaining risks were checked rather than assumed:

- **`mapEventToTaskStatus`** — the whole reason for the exclusion. Now correct; mutation-
  proven below (remove the key → a dead session reports `status: "working"`).
- **Client-side enum validation** — none exists. `meta.event` becomes an attribute string on
  the rendered `<channel …>` tag; the documented client constraint is on meta KEY names
  (`[a-zA-Z0-9_]+`), not values.
- **The `failed`-only report_error hint in the bridge** — would have silently disappeared for
  timeouts. Widened to `failed || timeout`, and both now point at `get_diagnostics` first.
- **`INSTRUCTIONS`** — enumerated six events to the agent. `timeout` added, or the wire would
  have carried a value the agent was never told about.
- **`ReducerEvent.sessionStatus`** — its only user was the divergence. Deleted rather than
  left as a hook with no implementation; `LEGAL_TRANSITIONS` gets a real absorbing `timeout`
  row instead of laundering it through `failed`.

Cost: **G2 fails, exactly as forecast.** G1's three assertions in the same test still pass.

```text

370 |     expect(info.status).toBe("timeout");

374 |     expect(terminalWireEvents).toEqual(["failed"]);
                                     ^
error: expect(received).toEqual(expected)

(fail) SessionManager > G1/G2: timeout stays timeout in memory and meta while the wire reports failed
```

Line 375, `expect(events.some((event) => event.type === "timeout")).toBe(false)`, is the
other half and will invert too; the test aborts at 374 before reaching it. The test's own
name and its comment ("the current seven-value channel wire") both need rewriting, not just
the two expectations — G1 and G2 are no longer the same fact.

## 3. TWO MORE tests fail, and they are supposed to

`ai-docs/architecture/mcp-channel.md` states the rule: *"The roster is pinned by an EXACT
frozen array in `channel/e2e-channel.test.ts`, so adding or removing a tool without updating
that test fails CI. That is deliberate: it is a wire contract."* `get_diagnostics` is a new
tool, so both pins fire. This is the guard working, not collateral damage — but it is a
second and third test change the task did not anticipate, and it is not mine to make.

```text
(fail) Group 1: MCP Protocol — channel capability > lists the exact public tool roster
    "create_session",
+   "get_diagnostics",
    "get_output",
  at …/packages/cli/src/channel/e2e-channel.test.ts:87:19

(fail) Group 1b: MCP Protocol — channel-only tools > lists only the 5 channel tools when CLAUDISH_MCP_TOOLS=channel
    "create_session",
+   "get_diagnostics",
    "get_output",
  at …/packages/cli/src/channel/e2e-channel.test.ts:262:19
```

The second one's TITLE also needs changing — there are six channel tools now, not five.

## 4. What `get_diagnostics` returns, and the two judgement calls in it

Beyond the requested fields (`terminalReason`, `exitCode`, `outputBytes`, `elapsedSeconds`,
`timeoutSeconds`, `transcriptPath`, `model` + `spawnModel`, tokens/cost/tools, the event
tail, the stderr tail) it also returns `sessionDir`, `eventLogPath`, `upstreamErrorLogPath`,
`anomalies`, `stderrFiltered`, `stderrTruncated` and `eventsTotal` — every one of which
answers "is what I am looking at the whole of it, and where is the rest".

### 4.1 stderr: filtered on success, RAW on everything else

The task's nuance, implemented as team states it at `team-orchestrator.ts:447-455`. The
`meaningfulStderr` filter runs ONLY for `status === "completed"`; any other status returns
the raw buffer. `stderrFiltered` reports which rule ran, so a reader is never guessing.

Both are redacted here, which they were NOT before: `entry.stderr` is the unredacted
in-memory buffer (only the on-disk `stderr.log` was redacted at write time), and the old
`getDiagnostics` returned `entry.stderr.slice(...)` verbatim. That was a live credential leak
into an agent's context waiting for a tool to call it.

### 4.2 `outputBytes` was wrong, and the probe caught it

`finalize` records its `[claudish] <verdict>` explanation through `recordProse`, which
increments `proseBytes`. So the field that proves a session produced nothing read **312 for
a 0-byte session** — the diagnostic falsifying the metric it exists to explain. Split into
`recordNote` (scrollback + `output.log`, no accounting) vs `recordProse` (accounting too).
`get_output` is unchanged: the explanation is still in the prose an agent reads.

### 4.3 The event ring is in memory, not a tail-read of `events.jsonl`

200 frames × 800 chars, `type:subtype`-labelled, redacted once and shared with the file.
It keeps filling after the file's 4 MB cap, because the frames just before a death are
precisely the ones a post-mortem wants and a capped FILE must not also blind the API.
`event_limit` is clamped to `[0, 200]`.

## 5. `transcriptPath`, and where the realpath actually bites

`transcriptPathFor` lives in `session/session-discovery.ts` — the module that documents the
layout and already exports `PROJECTS_DIR` and `slugForPath`. It is the repo's only
`realpathSync`. `refreshTranscriptPath` re-derives only when `cwd + uuid` changes, so the
syscall does not run on every `list_sessions`.

**Measured, and worth knowing before anyone "simplifies" it:** the child's own
`system:init.cwd` is ALREADY resolved, because Node's `process.cwd()` resolves symlinks. So
once the child has spoken, a raw slug of the reported cwd happens to be right. The realpath
matters for the window BEFORE `system:init` — and that window is exactly where a startup
failure lands, which is the case this whole phase exists for. Mutation P3 shows it: with
`realpathSync` removed the pre-init path is
`…/projects/-var-folders-…-T-chan-p3-symlink-XXXX/<uuid>.jsonl`, a directory that does not
exist, instead of `-private-var-folders-…`.

## 6. `CLAUDISH_UPSTREAM_ERROR_LOG` — and a leak that came with it

Set unconditionally per session, overriding any inherited value: the records carry no session
id, so a shared path interleaves up to 20 concurrent sessions into one unattributable file,
and `get_diagnostics` publishes this path as the session's own.

`captureUpstreamError` did **not** redact. That was defensible while it was opt-in and the
user named the path; it is not, now that claudish sets the path for every channel session and
returns the contents to an agent. A 401/403 body routinely echoes the credential that failed.
Redaction added at write time (the codebase's stated rule — the only point that covers every
reader) and BEFORE truncation, so a cut cannot leave a usable prefix of a key in the file.
Its six existing tests are untouched and still pass.

## 7. Verification, verbatim

## 8. Probes

`probes/probe-phase3.ts` (in-process) and `probes/probe-phase3-mcp.ts` (drives the REAL MCP
server over stdio JSON-RPC — the map, the bridge and the tool registry are only observable
through a client). `probes/fake-claudish-upstream.ts` is a `CLAUDISH_BIN` stand-in that calls
the REAL `captureUpstreamError` from the tree, so what is proven is the production function
writing to the path the transport handed it.

### Mutation proof

Applied with `bun run probes/mutate.ts <id> apply`, reversed with `… revert`; every reversal
is verified by the script's anchor check, and both probes are green after every revert.

| mutation | what it restores | observed failure |
|---|---|---|
| `P1` | `EVENT_TO_TASK_STATUS` without the `timeout` key | P6 ×2 — the timed-out session reports SEP-1686 `status: "working"`, i.e. still alive |
| `P2` | `meaningfulStderr` on every path | P2 ×3 — `stderrTail` is `""` for the exact incident the tool exists to explain |
| `P3` | slug the cwd as handed to us, no `realpathSync` | P3 ×2 — `-var-folders-…` instead of `-private-var-folders-…`, a directory that does not exist |
| `P4` | `CLAUDISH_UPSTREAM_ERROR_LOG` left unset | P4 ×5 — child env `null`, zero records, nothing to read back |
| `P5` | the failure note counted as model output | P2 ×1 — `outputBytes` 312 for a session that produced nothing |
| `P6` | `captureUpstreamError` without redaction | P4 ×1 — `sk-ant-api03-PROBESECRET` verbatim in `upstream-errors.jsonl` and in the tool's reply |

**`mutate.ts` bit back once, and the trap is worth recording.** `P1`'s first `broken` anchor
was the bare `]);`, which is not unique in `mcp-server.ts` — `String.replace` put the
reverted key back inside `resolveToolGroups`, producing a file that still ran and a probe
failure indistinguishable from "the mutation survived the revert". The anchor now carries the
preceding comment line. Any future mutation anchor must be unique in its file.

## 9. Left undone, deliberately

- **A client-side agent-name check in `create_session`** (§4.4). Still open. It is a
  different concern from diagnostics and wants `assertAgentAvailable` semantics, which the
  other session has just been changing.
- **Reading `events.jsonl` back through the tool.** `get_diagnostics` names the path but
  returns the in-memory ring. A file-backed `get_events(session_id, offset)` would serve a
  session evicted from the map 30 minutes on; nothing needs it yet.
- **`ChannelEvent.type` is still `string`.** Typing it `ChannelEventType` would make the
  bridge's event handling exhaustive. Out of scope, and it touches every notifier.
