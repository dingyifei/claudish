/**
 * Run a command and refuse to let it damage the developer's real claudish config.
 *
 *   bun run scripts/guard-real-config.ts -- bun test
 *   bun run test:safe
 *
 * Why this exists: three e2e test files used to sandbox by overwriting the real
 * `~/.claudish/config.json` and restoring it in `afterEach`. A killed or
 * timed-out run skipped the restore, so the fixture became permanent. That
 * destroyed a real user's `onepasswordAccount` and `onepasswordEnvironments`,
 * which silently disabled 1Password for every claudish run on that machine —
 * and because the failure mode is "1Password is never consulted", nothing
 * errored. It just quietly stopped working.
 *
 * Those files now use `setConfigFileOverride`, but the fix is a convention and
 * conventions decay. This guard is the enforcement: it does not care WHICH test
 * misbehaves, only that the file came out the way it went in. Snapshot, run,
 * compare, restore, fail loudly.
 *
 * Restoring rather than only reporting is deliberate. By the time a developer
 * reads the failure their config is already replaced, and — as happened here —
 * the `.bak` alongside it may be a clobbered copy from an earlier run. Putting
 * the bytes back is the part that actually saves them.
