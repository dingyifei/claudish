/**
 * Run a command and refuse to let it damage the developer's real claudish config.
 *
 *   bun run scripts/guard-real-config.ts -- bun test
 *   bun run test:safe
 *
 * Why this exists: three e2e test files used to sandbox by overwriting the real
 * `~/.claudish/config.json` and restoring it in `afterEach`. A killed or
 * timed-out run skipped the restore, so the fixture became permanent. That
 * destroyed a real user's `onepasswordAccount` and `onepasswordEnvironments`,
 * which silently disabled 1Password for every claudish run on that machine —
 * and because the failure mode is "1Password is never consulted", nothing
 * errored. It just quietly stopped working.
 *
 * Those files now use `setConfigFileOverride`, but the fix is a convention and
 * conventions decay. This guard is the enforcement: it does not care WHICH test
 * misbehaves, only that the file came out the way it went in. Snapshot, run,
 * compare, restore, fail loudly.
 *
 * Restoring rather than only reporting is deliberate. By the time a developer
 * reads the failure their config is already replaced, and — as happened here —
 * the `.bak` alongside it may be a clobbered copy from an earlier run. Putting
 * the bytes back is the part that actually saves them.
 *
 * GUARDED is a list rather than one path because the convention decayed again,
 * in exactly the shape the paragraph above describes. `all-models.json` is the
 * hosted model catalog's disk cache, and `effort-mapping.test.ts` seeds a
 * fixture into it and restores in a `finally`. That is the same save/restore
 * pattern the config files used, with the same hole: a killed or timed-out run
 * skips the restore and the two-entry fixture becomes the machine's permanent
 * catalog. It fails the way the config damage did — silently, as wrong routing
 * and wrong reasoning decisions rather than an error — because a stale catalog
 * is indistinguishable from a cold one to every caller.
 *
 * The seam that would remove the need is missing, which is why the test writes
 * the real path at all: `findCacheEntry(modelId, cachePath?)` accepts an
 * override, but `BaseApiFormat.lookupReasoningCapability` calls
 * `lookupModelReasoning(this.modelId)` with no way to pass one, so a dialect
 * test cannot redirect the read. `catalog-client.ts` solved the same problem
 * with an in-memory seam (`_setCatalogEntriesForTest`); `model-catalog.ts` has
 * no equivalent. Until it does, this guard is the backstop.

// `CLAUDISH_DISABLE_KEYCHAIN=1` makes `hasKeychainSource()` return false, so no
// suite can spawn `security` against the login keychain. This is not
// hypothetical: `keychain.enabled` in a real config was enough to make an
// unrelated test run enumerate it. The keychain is worse than the config file
// in one respect — a mutation there cannot be snapshotted and restored the way
// the bytes of a JSON file can — so it is prevented rather than repaired.
//
// `CLAUDISH_DISABLE_OP=1` is set for the same reason: 1Password arbitrates its
// handshake machine-wide, and a burst of denials from a test run suppresses
// authorization for every process on the machine for 15 seconds.
//
// `CLAUDISH_DISABLE_CATALOG_WARM=1` is the third. `createProxyServer` fires
// `warmCatalog()` on every create, which live-fetches the hosted catalog and
// writes `all-models.json` — so a suite that builds a proxy reads the network
// and rewrites the machine. Prevention beats the snapshot here for the same
// reason it does for the keychain: the restore below puts the bytes back, but
// it cannot put back the hermeticity. A test whose result depends on what the
// hosted catalog said this morning is the failure that turned two DeepSeek
// tests red mid-release.
//
// `CLAUDISH_CATALOG_INCOMPATIBLE_PATH` is the fourth, and it REDIRECTS rather
// than disables. The contract sentinel is state a real build writes on every
// launch against a newer catalog, so on a developer's machine it usually
// EXISTS — and every default-path read in the suite then sees "this catalog is
// unreadable". Measured 2026-09-18: 25 tests failed on that alone, and CI,
// whose home directory never holds the file, stayed green. A fresh directory
// per run means no run can read a sentinel an earlier run wrote either.
