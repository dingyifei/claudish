/**
 * Catalog contract compatibility — a PERSISTENT sentinel, not a detector.
 *
 * models-index publishes the model catalog under a contract version. This build
 * reads {@link SUPPORTED_CONTRACT_VERSION}. When the server moves past it, an
 * un-updated claudish does not crash — which is the problem. It reads a body
 * whose shape it does not recognise, finds no `entries`, no `plans`, no
 * `subscriptionPlans`, and concludes with complete confidence that it knows of
 * no subscription covering the model in hand. Routing then does what it does for
 * any model no plan covers: it picks a metered provider. A flat-rate user is
 * billed per token and nothing anywhere says so. That silence — not a crash — is
 * the defect this file exists to prevent.
 *
 * ## Why the finding has to outlive the process that made it
 *
 * Detection alone cannot help. `getCatalogEntries()` reads the memory cache,
 * then `~/.claudish/all-models.json`, and only fetches when both come back
 * empty. A client with a warm disk cache therefore never contacts the server at
 * all and never learns the contract moved. Worse, the one process that DOES see
 * the new contract is often a `claudish --models-refresh` that exits a second
 * later; if the finding died with it, the next launch would route off the stale
 * v2 file and mis-bill exactly as before.
 *
 * So the finding is written to `~/.claudish/catalog-incompatible.json` and read
 * back on every subsequent start, until a compatible response is seen again and
 * {@link clearCatalogIncompatibility} removes it.
 *
 * ## Why the record is RE-JUDGED on every read, never merely read back
 *
 * What is persisted is not a fact about the world. It is a RELATIONSHIP between
 * two versions — what the server was serving, and what the build that met it
 * could read — and persisting a relationship only freezes one half of it. The
 * other half, {@link SUPPORTED_CONTRACT_VERSION}, changes underneath the file
 * the moment `claudish update` runs.
 *
 * Keyed on presence alone, a record written by a v2 build against a v3 server
 * still fires on the v3 build shipped to end it, and
 * {@link catalogIncompatibilityMessage} then reads "the catalog serves contract
 * version 3; this build reads version 3 ... run `claudish update`" — naming the
 * remedy the user has just applied. That is a permanent brick delivered by the
 * release meant to fix the problem, and it needs no network to happen. So every
 * read re-evaluates the record against the CURRENT constant
 * ({@link isSentinelStale}) and drops it once this build has caught up.
 *
 * ## Why the disk write is best-effort but the flag is not
 *
 * A read-only home, a full disk or a sandboxed test must never turn a billing
 * guard into a crash, so every fs call here is wrapped. But swallowing a failed
 * write and returning nothing would leave the RUNNING process routing off a
 * catalog it has just proved it cannot read. The in-memory flag is therefore set
 * first and independently of the write: the file buys protection for the NEXT
 * process, the memory flag protects this one.
 *
 * ## Zero dependencies, on purpose
 *
 * Node builtins only. The catalog client, the disk cache and the routing engine
 * all import this module, and those three already import one another; a single
 * non-builtin import here would thread a cycle through the middle of routing.

 * Has this build caught up with what the record describes?

 * every time the user updates. See the header section on re-judging.
 *
 * Three questions, ordered by how much each one actually knows:
 *
 *  1. **Did the server name a floor we are still below?** Then no amount of
 *     other evidence matters — the server has said in as many words that it will
 *     not serve this build. Decisive, and it cannot brick: a build at or above
 *     the floor never reaches this branch.
 *
 *  2. **Did the server name the version it was serving?** Then judge by that
 *     alone: `<=` ours means we now read what it was serving, so the finding is
 *     spent. `>` ours means we still cannot, and the message stays true and
 *     actionable ("publishes 4, this build reads 3"). Note this deliberately
 *     answers the question WITHOUT consulting the writer's version — a record
 *     saying "server 4" written by a v2 build still applies to this v3 build,
 *     and clearing it on the writer's age alone would hand a stale v2 cache to
 *     bare-name routing, which is the mis-billing this module exists to stop.
 *
 *  3. **Nothing on the wire to judge** (a body-less 426 records `null` for both
 *     server fields). Then judge the WRITER: a record from a build that read an
 *     OLDER contract than we do describes a client that no longer exists, and
 *     nothing else will ever clear it — the updated user who is offline, or whom
 *     the server has since started answering, would carry it forever. Strictly
 *     less than, so the ordinary "same build, still too old" record keeps firing.
 *
 * An absent `clientContractVersion` (a record from before that field existed)
 * falls out of question 3 as "not stale": unknown, so assume nothing. Question 2
 * is then the only thing that can clear it, which is exactly the pre-existing
 * behaviour for those records.
