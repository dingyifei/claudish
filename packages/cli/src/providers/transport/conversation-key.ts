 * Keyed on Claude Code's own session id (`metadata.user_id` → `session_id`),
 * which is stable for every turn of a session, survives a claudish restart
 * mid-conversation, and cannot collide between two concurrent conversations.
 * Contrast a `cwd`-derived key, which is the same value for two unrelated
 * sessions in one repo and outlives them both.
 *
 * The id is HASHED rather than sent raw. It is not a secret, but it is a
 * local correlation handle that also appears in transcripts and in the
 * behavior journal, and a stable one-way digest serves every consumer exactly
 * as well. `device_id` and `account_uuid` from that same blob are never read
 * at all — see `extractSessionId`.
 *
 * A pure function of the request: callers must pass the request in hand, never
 * a value stashed on a transport, because one transport instance serves
 * overlapping conversations (see `ProviderTransport.getHeaders`).
