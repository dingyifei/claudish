/**
 * OpenAI Codex ProviderTransport
 *
 * Extends OpenAI transport with OAuth token support for ChatGPT Plus/Pro subscriptions.
 *
 * The transport no longer manages OAuth itself. On each request, composed-handler
 * calls refreshAuth() (BEFORE transformPayload/getEndpoint/getHeaders), which
 * delegates to the credential authority's getRequestAuth("openai-codex"). The
 * authority's Codex credential mints the OAuth artifact (chatgpt.com endpoint +
 * OAuth headers + store:false/include payload transform), and applies the
 * OPENAI_CODEX_API_KEY fallback internally.
 *
 * When OAuth is unavailable the authority FALLS THROUGH to that api-key half, which
 * returns an artifact of its own — an endpoint-less one, so getEndpoint()/getHeaders()
 * below land on the plain api-key path (api.openai.com + Bearer key) from the OpenAI
 * base transport. `cachedAuth` stays null ONLY when getRequestAuth throws, which
 * needs an AVAILABLE OAuth primary whose refresh was then rejected. An earlier
 * version of this comment ran the two together ("throws/falls through … cachedAuth
 * stays null") and a billing discriminator was built on it; see refreshAuth().
 *
 * IMPORTANT: OAuth tokens only work with chatgpt.com/backend-api, NOT api.openai.com.

    // `{headers:{Authorization:"Bearer sk-…"}}` with a key, `{headers:{}}` without
    // one. It never returns null and never throws. So `cachedAuth` is null only
    // when getRequestAuth THREW, i.e. an available OAuth primary whose refresh was
    // rejected. Truthiness therefore labelled every plain api-key request — and
    // every credential-less one — `subscription`, reporting SUB and $0 accrued
    // while OpenAI metered the request at api.openai.com.
    //
    // Truthiness IS a valid selector for getEndpoint()/getHeaders() below, because
    // those treat null as "use the api-key path" and a metered artifact carries no
    // endpoint override, so both land on the same behaviour. It is not valid for
    // billing. Three reviewers read the old line as correct; that is why this
