/**
 * Activation for the BUNDLED endpoint catalog.
 *
 * A catalog row is compiled into exactly the `CustomEndpointComplex` object a
 * user would have hand-written and handed to `registerEndpoint()` — the same
 * validate → definition → profile → register×3 sequence user config travels. So
 * there is no new request path here, no new transport, no new
 * `PROVIDER_PROFILES` entry, and nothing that can silently mis-route. What this
 * module owns is only the four questions the loader cannot answer for itself:
 * may this row register at all, should it, where does its key come from, and
 * where does it point.
 *
 * ── The activation predicate, and why it is ordered the way it is ───────────
 *
 * A row registers iff:
 *
 *     NOT globally disabled          (config `enabled: false`, or
 *                                     CLAUDISH_NO_PREDEFINED_ENDPOINTS=1)
 *  AND NOT a duplicate of an earlier row
 *  AND NOT colliding with a builtin name/shortcut/legacy prefix or picker alias
 *  AND NOT already registered at run time
 *  AND NOT replaced by a user `customEndpoints` entry of the same name
 *  AND NOT individually disabled
 *  AND (a locally-present credential OR an explicit `enable` entry)
 *  AND its base URL resolves
 *
 * REFUSALS come before PERMISSIONS. A user may opt IN to a vendor they have no
 * key for; a user may not opt in to shadowing a builtin, because the thing the
 * collision check prevents is not an inconvenience to them — it is one
 * provider quietly answering in another's namespace, which is this project's
 * worst documented failure class.
 *
 * The base-URL check is the one refusal placed AFTER the permission gate, and
 * deliberately: it is scoped to rows that would otherwise activate, so a stray
 * `*_BASE_URL` belonging to a vendor the user has no key for produces silence
 * rather than a warning about a provider they never asked for.
 *
 * ── Why registration itself is what gets gated ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * There is no "registered but hidden" state: `buildProviderDefinition` sets
 * `shortcuts: [name]`, and both the picker roster (`isPickableProvider`) and
 * the `@prefix` alias table are DERIVED from that. The picker's own list is
 * credential-filtered, but `getProviderFilterAliases()` is not — so registering
 * every bundled vendor unconditionally would pollute the `@prefix` namespace
 * and its partial-match resolver with vendors that cannot serve a request, and
 * would cost one async credential resolution per row per picker open, each able
 * to open a 1Password handshake on a machine where concurrent handshakes are
 * arbitrated globally.
 *
 * Which is why the credential question is asked with `hasLocalApiKey()` — env →
 * aliases → `config.apiKeys`, and SYNCHRONOUS, which is the whole guarantee:
 * the 1Password SDK sits behind an `await` inside the authority's async
 * `resolveKey`, so a path that cannot await cannot reach it. Note that this is
 * sync-ness, NOT import-graph isolation — `op-source` and `@1password/sdk` are
 * in this module's static import closure via `custom-endpoints-loader` →
 * `authority` → `api-key-credential`, so an `await` added anywhere on the
 * registration path would re-open the door without changing a signature.
 * `hasLocalApiKey` is used and NOT `credentials.isAvailable()`: a bundled row
 * is not in the authority's map until `registerEndpoint` puts it there, so that
 * call answers `false` for every row and the catalog would never activate at all.
 *
 * Consequence, stated plainly: a key that lives ONLY behind an `op://`
 * reference cannot activate a row, because activation is sync and 1Password is
 * async. Once a row IS active its op:// key resolves through the normal
 * authority path with no special-casing (the compiled entry carries
 * `apiKey: "${VENDOR_API_KEY}"`, so the declared-key step returns `undefined`
 * when the var is unset and the async step runs). The escape hatches are
 * `predefinedEndpoints.enable`, or exporting the variable.
 *
 * Everything here is NON-FATAL: warn to stderr, skip the row, continue. There
 * is no `process.exit` in this feature, on the precedent that a bad import must
 * never lock a user out of `claudish config`.
