 * Design rules:
 * - Exact behaviour match — every profile must produce the same transport+adapter+options as the

 * - Special cases (opencode-zen, vertex) keep their branching logic inside the profile's factory

/**
 * Models OpenAI will not serve over /v1/chat/completions.
 *
 * Two different reasons, one remedy. `gpt-5.6` rejects function tools together
 * with reasoning_effort ("use /v1/responses or set reasoning_effort to 'none'").
 * A `*codex*` model rejects the endpoint outright, and says so in as many words
 * — measured 2026-08-10 straight against api.openai.com with `gpt-5.3-codex`:
 *
 *   POST /v1/chat/completions → 404 "This model is not supported in the
 *                                    v1/chat/completions endpoint. Use the
 *                                    v1/responses endpoint instead."
 *   POST /v1/responses        → 200
 *
 * So this is not the tools-plus-reasoning constraint wearing a second face; it
 * is a flatly Responses-only model. Claude Code sends tools on essentially every
 * request, which made every codex id unusable through `oai@` rather than merely
 * degraded.
 *
 * THE SUBSTRING TEST IS LOAD-BEARING, and it is not a style choice.
 * `OpenAIProviderTransport` has carried the same rule since long before this —
 * `modelName.toLowerCase().includes("codex")` decides both its stream format
 * (openai.ts:31) and its endpoint (openai.ts:37) — so Layer 3 was ALREADY
 * sending every codex id to /v1/responses. Only Layer 1 disagreed: this gate
 * matched `gpt-5.6` alone, so `openaiProfile` built an OpenAIAPIFormat and put
 * a Chat Completions body on a Responses endpoint. That mismatch is the whole
 * failure, and it is exactly what OpenAI reported back:
 *
 *   400 unsupported_parameter — "Unsupported parameter: 'messages'. In the
 *   Responses API, this parameter has moved to 'input'."
 *
 * Right endpoint, wrong body. Any narrowing of this test (a `/^gpt-.*codex/`
 * prefix, an explicit id list) silently re-opens the split, because the
 * transport will keep routing ids this function no longer claims. The two tests
 * must stay identical; a test pins their agreement.
 *
 * THE GATE IS HOST-BLIND, and the comment here used to say otherwise ("only
 * OpenAI-served ids reach this gate"). `openaiProfile` is many-to-one — it also
 * serves x-ai, qwen, deepseek and mistralai (`provider-definitions.ts:228`) — so
 * every one of those hosts reaches this function. `endpoints.openai` is keyed by
 * TRANSPORT FAMILY, not by host, so the catalog cannot say "responses on OpenAI,
 * chat completions on x-ai" about one model id.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-09 against the live catalog, nothing is mis-served by that:
 * all 8 Responses-only ids are `gpt-*`, which no other host under this profile
 * carries. The exposure is a future id served by two hosts on different APIs.
 *
 * `cx@` really is untouched, for a different reason than the old comment gave:
 * `openaiCodexProfile` builds `CodexAPIFormat` unconditionally and never calls
 * this function at all.
 *
 * Pick the verification model carefully. /v1/models is a CATALOGUE, not a served
 * set: of those six ids, only `gpt-5.3-codex` actually answers 200 on
 * /v1/responses for the developer's account — the rest return 404 "Model not
 * found" there, and `gpt-5-codex` is additionally reported DEPRECATED on
 * /v1/chat/completions. Testing against any of them looks exactly like "the
 * routing fix did not work" when the model is simply not being served. Same
 * catalogue-vs-served-set trap the Antigravity and Devin providers document.
 *
 * THE CATALOG MAY ONLY WIDEN THIS GATE, NEVER NARROW IT. The name rule stays an
 * unconditional `||` below for the reason above: the transport routes every
 * `*codex*` id to /v1/responses on its own, so a catalog record that said "chat
 * completions" for one would restore the split in the other direction —
 * OpenAIAPIFormat's body on a Responses endpoint.
 *
 * The name rule alone could not stay correct, which is what this comment
 * predicted and what then happened. `gpt-6-astra` shipped 2026-09-03, matches
 * neither pattern, and is Responses-only. Its Chat Completions body carried the
 * catalog's own `tokenParam` and was rejected:
 *
 *   400 unknown_parameter — "Unknown parameter: 'max_output_tokens'."
 *
 * `max_output_tokens` is the Responses spelling. claudish was already reading
 * half of the catalog's endpoint contract — `tokenParam`, via
 * `OpenAIAPIFormat.tokenParamName` — while ignoring the sibling field that says
 * which wire API that spelling belongs to. Reading both is the fix. The name
 * rule survives only as the cold-cache fallback, where the catalog has no
 * opinion to read.
 *
 * @param cachePath Test seam. Points the catalog lookup at a fixture, so a test
 *   never depends on a warm `~/.claudish/all-models.json`.

/**
 * OpenCode Zen / Zen Go — two tiers:

 *   zgo/  (opencode-zen-go): go-plan models (glm-5, minimax-m2.5, kimi-k2.5) via zen/go/v1/
 *
 * ZEN REQUIRES A REAL KEY (changed 2026-08-22). The catalog used to declare
 * `publicKeyFallback: "public"`, so the credential authority emitted the literal
 * string "public" whenever no real key resolved and `ctx.apiKey` was always
 * populated here. Measured: the endpoint answers `401 — Missing API key` to
 * that token, so the "free anonymous" tier it modelled does not exist (or no
 * longer does). The affordance is removed entirely; `ctx.apiKey` can now be
 * empty here, exactly as for any other keyed provider without a key.
 *
 * Model routing inside the profile:
 *   - GPT-* models    → OpenAIProviderTransport (/v1/responses) + CodexAPIFormat (Responses API)
 *   - All other models → OpenAIProviderTransport (/v1/chat/completions) + OpenAIAPIFormat (delta-aware)
 *
 * MiniMax models take the SAME OpenAI path as everything else. They briefly had
 * their own Anthropic branch (AnthropicProviderTransport + AnthropicAPIFormat),
 * added to cure a `401 {"type":"AuthError","message":"Missing API key."}` — but
 * that 401 was purely an auth-HEADER problem: the Anthropic transport defaults to
 * `x-api-key` and only sends Bearer when the provider declares
 * `authScheme: "bearer"`, which neither Zen definition does (their own OpenAI
 * transport is Bearer-only, so they never needed to). Swapping in an entire
 * transport+format pair to fix a header carried an endpoint assumption that does
 * not hold here: AnthropicProviderTransport builds its URL as
 * `baseUrl + provider.apiPath`, and BOTH Zen tiers declare
 * `apiPath: "/v1/chat/completions"`. So an Anthropic-shaped body was being posted
 * to an OpenAI endpoint.
 *
 * That survived verification because a tool-free Anthropic body is close enough to
 * an OpenAI one to be accepted. Tools are where the shapes diverge: Anthropic tools
 * carry `input_schema` and NO `type` field, and MiniMax validates them OpenAI-style,
 * reporting the missing type as empty. Measured live 2026-08-08 against
 * `opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/chat/completions`:
 *
 *   anthropic body + tools  → 400 "invalid params, invalid tool type:  (2013)"
 *   anthropic body, NO tools → 200        ← why the original fix looked correct
 *   openai body + tools      → 200
 *   openai body + tools + stream → 200, real tool_calls frames (m2.5 and m3)
 *   anthropic body → /v1/messages → 401 AuthError (no usable Anthropic route)
 *
 * Every Claude Code request carries tools, so this failed 100% of real turns. The
 * non-Go tier is structurally identical (same apiPath, same transport) and shares
 * the fix; it could not be re-measured without an OPENCODE_API_KEY.
