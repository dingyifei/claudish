/**
 * Live, per-subscription model discovery.
 *
 * Some providers serve a model roster — and per-model context windows — that
 * the cloud catalog CANNOT know statically, because the answer depends on the
 * caller's subscription tier. Kimi Code is the motivating case: `k3` advertises
 * a 1M context window, but only on Allegretto or higher; a Moderato subscriber
 * sending 1M tokens gets a hard 400. The same shape exists for other coding
 * subscriptions.
 *
 * A provider opts in by declaring `modelDiscovery` in its ProviderDefinition.
 * We then call the provider's own authenticated model-listing endpoint, which
 * — because it is authenticated — answers for THIS user's subscription. That
 * is strictly better than modelling tiers locally: tiers get renamed, added,
 * and grandfathered, but the endpoint always reports what the key can do now.
 *
 * Design rules:
 * - **Fail-soft.** Every failure path returns an empty list. Discovery is an
 *   enhancement; it must never block a launch or a picker.
 * - **Nothing hardcoded.** The endpoint is derived from the provider's own
 *   baseUrl (+ env overrides); model ids and windows come from the response.
 * - **Cached.** One network call per provider per TTL, shared process-wide —
 *   the picker, the launcher, and the status line all read the same result.
