/**
 * macOS Keychain secret store — the engine.
 *
 * A dependency-light wrapper over `/usr/bin/security` that stores one generic-
 * password item per API-key env var:
 *
 *   service = "claudish"
 *   account = the env var name          e.g. GEMINI_API_KEY
 *   label   = "claudish: GEMINI_API_KEY"   (findable in Keychain Access.app)
 *   value   = the secret (UTF-8, no control characters — see below)
 *
 * One item per variable rather than a single JSON blob: individually visible,
 * individually deletable, individually ACL'd by macOS. The blob layout would
 * collapse N spawns into one, but `dump-keychain` already collapses the only
 * operation that needed N — enumeration — so the blob buys nothing and costs
 * discoverability.
 *
 * WHY THE `security` CLI AND NOT A NATIVE BINDING
 *
 * A keychain item's ACL is bound to the code signature of the binary that
 * accesses it. `/usr/bin/security` is Apple-signed and its path is stable, so a
 * value written through it reads back through it without a new authorization
 * dialog. A native binding inside a `bun`-compiled executable presents a
 * DIFFERENT identity that changes with every rebuild and every `bun` upgrade —
 * which macOS surfaces as a fresh "claudish wants to access your keychain"
 * prompt each time. The subprocess is the less elegant option and the only one
 * that stays quiet.
 *
 * MEASURED COSTS (darwin 25.6.0; transcripts in
 * ai-docs/reports/keychain-security-cli-measurements.md)
 *
 *   find-generic-password -w   17.4 ms   per call, per variable
 *   dump-keychain (no -d)      28   ms   ONCE, for the entire item list
 *
 * That gap is the whole architecture. A per-variable read cannot sit on a
 * synchronous path — 25 providers would cost ~435 ms against a provider-
 * registration pass that runs in ~1.5-2 ms. Enumeration can: it answers
 * "which variables are stored?" for every provider in a single spawn.
 * `dump-keychain` reads item ATTRIBUTES only and never item DATA, which is why
 * it is prompt-free while a value read is not.
 *
 * WHY SECRETS GO ON STDIN
 *
 * `security add-generic-password -w <secret>` puts the secret in the process's
 * argv, where any other user on the machine can read it out of `ps` for the
 * duration of the call. Writes therefore go through `security -i`, which reads
 * the command itself from stdin, with the value carried as `-X <hex>` so no
 * shell-style quoting of quotes/backslashes/spaces is ever required.
 *
 * The documented alternative — `-w` passed LAST so `security` prompts for the
 * value — was measured and REJECTED: it demands the password twice, a single
 * piped line fails the confirmation, and it then exits 0 having created an item
 * with an EMPTY value. A write path that reports success while storing nothing
 * is worse than no write path at all.
 *
 * WHY CONTROL CHARACTERS ARE REJECTED
 *
 * `find-generic-password -w` prints the value as RAW text for printable data
 * but as a HEX STRING when the data contains control characters, with nothing
 * in the output to distinguish the two — a printable key that happens to be all
 * hex digits is genuinely ambiguous. Rather than guess at read time, values
 * containing control characters are refused at WRITE time, which makes every
 * stored value unambiguous by construction. API keys are single-line printable
 * tokens, so this rejects nothing a user actually has.
 *
 * Every side effect is behind an injectable `KeychainDeps` seam, so the module
 * is fully testable with no real keychain. Same rationale as
 * `auth/antigravity-token.ts`, which reads the SHARED agy/claudish token item
 * and is the existing precedent for talking to `security` from this codebase.

 * WHY `Bun.spawnSync` AND NOT `execFileSync` — this one is measured, and it is

 *
 * Node's `execFileSync(..., { input })` HANGS when the parent's stdin is in raw
 * mode or has an active `data` listener — which is exactly what any TUI does.
 * Measured inside the config TUI: the call blocked for the full timeout and came
 * back `status: null, signal: "SIGTERM", code: "ETIMEDOUT"`, with EMPTY stderr.
 * Because it is synchronous, it froze the whole interface for ten seconds first.
 * The identical code path succeeds from a plain CLI process, so this cannot be
 * caught anywhere except by driving the real TUI.
 *
 * `Bun.spawnSync` with a `Uint8Array` stdin has no such interaction — verified
 * under raw mode WITH a data listener attached: exit 0 in ~30ms, value round-
 * tripped. Bun's native spawn is also what the rest of claudish relies on, and
 * the launcher (`bin/claudish.cjs`) refuses to run under Node at all, so the
 * `Bun` global is guaranteed here.
 *
 * stderr is ALWAYS piped, never inherited. The most common keychain operation —
 * a lookup that misses — writes "SecKeychainSearchCopyNext: The specified item
 * could not be found" to it. Inheriting that would spray one line per provider
 * per resolution pass into a terminal claudish SHARES with the Claude Code TUI,
