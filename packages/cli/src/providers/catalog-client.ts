/**
 * The model catalog client — fetch, cache, and resolve, for ALL providers.
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for model facts. It fetches the Firebase
 * slim catalog, keeps it in memory and on disk (`~/.claudish/all-models.json`),
 * and answers "what does provider P call model M?" from `aggregators[]`.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * All of this previously lived inside `catalog-resolvers/openrouter.ts` behind
 * an `OpenRouterCatalogResolver` class, which made the app-wide catalog loader
 * look like an OpenRouter feature. It was not: `writeAllModelsCache` had exactly
 * one caller in the codebase, and every catalog read — context windows,
 * reasoning capability, tokenParam, routeVariant — depended on that class
 * having run. The name hid the dependency and made "why is there only one
 * resolver?" unanswerable.
 *
 * The per-provider resolver interface is gone with it. Name resolution was
 * never provider-specific logic — it is one lookup, `aggregators[]`, which the
 * catalog now populates for 18 providers. A registry of classes to perform one
 * table lookup per provider is a registry of one thing repeated.
 *
 * ## The two data sources, and which owns what
 *
 * - **This catalog (cloud, TTL'd)** owns model IDENTITY: what a model is, what
 *   it can do, what each provider calls it, what it costs. Same for everyone.
 * - **A provider's own live endpoint** (`model-discovery.ts`) owns ENTITLEMENT:
 *   which subset of those models THIS key may use, and the context window for
 *   THIS subscription tier. Per-user, and impossible to hold statically.
 *
 * They are joined on model id, not chained as fallbacks. There is deliberately
 * NO per-model cloud lookup for gaps: re-querying the same cloud one model at a
 * time returns the same answer N times more slowly. A field missing here is a
 * models-index gap to fix there.

 *     `Accept: application/vnd.models-index.catalog+json;version=3`, and this
 *     build sends no Accept header at all, so post-cutover it gets 426 and never
 *     once sees a v3 200 body. (Not sending that header is deliberate: it
 *     belongs to the v3 READER work. Asking for a contract we cannot parse would
 *     be worse than not asking.)
 *   - **a body `contractVersion` above ours**, because that field rides on every
 *     v3 error body — 410 and 503 included — so this catches a cutover that
 *     arrives wearing a status nobody wrote down.
 *
 * A body-less 426 still counts: the status alone is enough, and the sentinel
 * then records `serverContractVersion: null`, which the message renders as "a
 * newer catalog contract" rather than inventing a number.
