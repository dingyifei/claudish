 * at ANY length — and the map would then decode every call to whichever of them
 * was registered last, silently handing the model's call to the wrong tool.
 * Length was never the only way to collide.
 *
 * Every binding is recorded, identity ones included, because an identity
 * encoding CLAIMS that name: without the record, a later `a.b` would transform
 * onto an unregistered `a_b` and win it from the real `a_b`.
 *
 * The hash is the collision GUARD, not an inverse. A codec cannot be reversible
 * from an arbitrary-length name into a 64-character slot — the map is
