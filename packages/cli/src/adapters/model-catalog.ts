/**
 * Search the local catalog cache by model id or alias.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from the aggregator-listing search in the MCP server:
 * that one answers "what does OpenRouter sell", this one answers "what name
 * does claudish know". Only the second can resolve a subscription wire id.
 *
 * Ranking is exact-match first (an exact alias hit is the whole point — it is
 * how `k3` resolves to `kimi-k3`), then substring hits on the id, then
 * substring hits on an alias.
 *
 * Returns [] for a cold or missing cache. Callers MUST treat that as "no
 * information" rather than "no such model".
