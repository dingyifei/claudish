/**
 * QwenModelDialect — Layer 2 dialect for Qwen (Alibaba) models.
 *
 * Handles Qwen-specific quirks:
 * - Strips special tokens from output
 * - Maps Claude Code's effort onto DashScope's OpenAI-compatible reasoning
 *   knob (`enable_thinking` + `thinking_budget`).
 *
 * Qwen is reachable over TWO wires — DashScope's OpenAI-compatible API and Qwen
 * Plan's Anthropic-compatible endpoint (/apps/anthropic/v1/messages) — and they
 * do not share a reasoning knob. Only the DashScope half lives here: the
 * Anthropic half is a property of the WIRE, not of the Qwen family, so it lives
 * in BaseAPIFormat.applyAnthropicWireReasoning() where every dialect inherits
 * it. (Qwen Plan serves glm-5.2 and deepseek-v4-* over the same endpoint, so a
 * Qwen-only implementation left those two emitting knobs that endpoint ignores.)
 *
 * `applyNativeReasoning` is not called at all on the Anthropic wire, so nothing
 * here needs to branch on `wireFormat`.
