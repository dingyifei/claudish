/**
 * Credential SOURCE classification — the single implementation of the rules.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * There used to be two independent answers to "does this provider have a
 * credential, and where did it come from":
 *
 *   1. `CredentialProvider.isAvailable()` — the authority. ASYNC, so it can
 *      consult 1Password, but it returns a bare boolean: no source.
 *   2. `providerAuthSource()` in tui/providers.ts — SYNC, so the config TUI's
 *      React render paths can call it, but it reads `process.env` and config
 *      directly and therefore cannot see a 1Password-only key.
 *
 * Two implementations of one decision means a rule fixed in one place is
 * silently missed in the other. That is not hypothetical: the unexpanded
 * `${VAR}` guard had to be written into BOTH, and `claudish providers --json`
 * spent a release reporting `ready: false` for every 1Password-only provider
 * because it asked #2, which structurally cannot know.
 *
 * THE SPLIT THAT IS ACTUALLY INHERENT
 *
 * React cannot await. That is a real constraint, and it is the ONLY thing that
 * justifies a sync entry point. So the rules live here once, exposed twice:
 *
 *   - `describeSourceSync` — the rules, minus 1Password. For render paths.
 *   - `describeSource`     — readiness decided by the AUTHORITY (its return
 *                            value, not a side effect), labelled by the same
 *                            rules. For every caller that can await.
 *
 * The two differ in whether 1Password is consulted. They do not differ in what
 * counts as a credential — that is the property the old split kept losing.
 *
 * WIRE CONTRACT: the returned strings are consumed by the external
 * claude-desktop-profiles app via `claudish providers --json`. They are
 * deliberately byte-identical to what that command has always emitted. A
 * 1Password-resolved key reports "env", which is literally true — the authority
 * write-throughs it into `process.env` before this classifies. Naming 1Password
 * explicitly would mean adding a union member the profiles app has never seen,
 * so it waits for a coordinated change.

 * Where a provider's credential resolves from. `null` = nowhere.
 *
 * `"public"` is NO LONGER PRODUCED. It meant "the provider ships a built-in
 * free key", an affordance removed in 2026-08 because its single user
 * (OpenCode Zen) answered 401 to the hardcoded token and the mechanism made a
 * provider report Ready without ever issuing a request. The member is retained
 * because these strings are a WIRE CONTRACT read by the external
 * claude-desktop-profiles app via `claudish providers --json`: dropping it from
 * the union costs a coordinated release for no gain, while leaving it costs an
 * unreachable branch the consumer may still switch on harmlessly.
 *
 * A genuinely keyless provider is `authScheme: "none"`, which reports as normal
 * readiness rather than a distinct source.

 * THE RULES. Sync, so React render paths can call it — which also means it
 * cannot consult 1Password. A key that lives only in 1Password reads as absent
 * here UNTIL the authority has resolved it and write-through'd it into
 * `process.env`; `describeSource` below guarantees that ordering for callers
 * that can await.
 *
 * Priority depends on whether the provider has OAuth login support:
 *
 *   For OAuth-capable providers (antigravity, openai-codex, kimi-coding):
 *   OAuth wins over env/cfg. These products are designed around the OAuth flow
 *   as the canonical auth path; an env key is usually a stale leftover or
 *   sideband override and shouldn't be the advertised method in the UI.
 *
 *   Local providers are ready only when explicitly enabled in global
 *   ~/.claudish/config.json; for all others: env > cfg > (no OAuth path).
 *
 * Returns:
 *   "local"  - local provider explicitly enabled in global config
 *   "oauth"  - valid OAuth credentials on disk (OAuth-capable providers)
 *   "e+c"    - both env var AND config-file key present
 *   "env"    - env var only
 *   "cfg"    - config-file key only
 *   null     - no credentials of any kind
 *
 * `"public"` is never returned — see the CredentialSource doc. A provider that
 * needs no credential now declares `authScheme: "none"`, which the AUTHORITY
 * reports as available; it has no distinct display source because there is no
 * credential to describe.

/**
 * Readiness from the AUTHORITY, label from the same rules above.

 * oauth-file → 1Password — and this uses its RETURN VALUE, not the side effect
 * of it happening to populate `process.env`. If the authority says a provider
 * has no credential, the answer is `null` no matter what the sync rules think.
 *
 * The `?? "env"` floor covers the one legitimate disagreement: the authority
 * can resolve through a path the sync rules do not model (an alias env var, an
 * `oauthFallback` file on a provider with no `oauthSlug`). Reporting "env"
 * there is better than contradicting the oracle with `null` — and it can never
 * fire in the other direction, because a `null` from the authority short-
 * circuits above.
 *
 * Never throws: `isAvailable` swallows its own failures by contract, so a
 * 1Password outage degrades to "not ready" rather than an exception.
