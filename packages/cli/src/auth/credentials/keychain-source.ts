/**
 * keychain-source — the lazy macOS Keychain seam BEHIND the credential authority.
 *
 * The single place that knows how to pull a provider's API key out of the macOS
 * Keychain on demand. The authority calls `resolveKeychainKeyForEnvVars(wanted)`
 * only when env / aliases / config have all missed — so a user whose key is
 * already in the shell environment never spawns `security` at all.
 *
 * LAZINESS GATE: `hasKeychainSource()` is a cheap SYNC sniff — the platform,
 * plus one boolean in `config.json`. It returns false WITHOUT touching the
 * keychain when the backend was never opted into, which is the whole reason the
 * `keychain.enabled` flag exists. Deliberately parallel to `hasOpSources()`.
 *
 * ORDER: this source is consulted BEFORE 1Password. The keychain is local,
 * costs ~17ms, and once its ACL is established it never prompts; a 1Password
 * resolve is a desktop-app handshake that can be denied, and a burst of denials
 * trips a 15-second machine-wide suppression (see architecture/onepassword.md).
 * Cheap and quiet goes first. An explicit env var or a config-stored key still
 * wins over both — a user who exports a key means it.
 *
 * WRITE-THROUGH, AND WHY THERE IS NO NEW `CredentialSource` MEMBER:
 * a resolved keychain value is written into `process.env` by the authority, the
 * same mechanism 1Password already uses. The strings in `CredentialSource` are
 * a WIRE CONTRACT consumed by the external profiles app through
 * `claudish providers --json` (see source.ts), so a keychain key reports "env"
 * — which is literally true once it has been written through. Origin is tracked
 * separately here, for display only, via `isKeychainHydratedVar`.

 * Load every stored keychain secret into `process.env`, gap-filling only.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: `describeSourceSync` cannot await, so the config TUI's
 * readiness dots, "configured first" sort and not-configured divider would all
 * report a keychain-only provider as unconfigured until something happened to
 * resolve it. Hydrating up front is exactly how 1Password's keys become visible
 * to the same sync rules — the classifier sees a real `process.env` entry, and
 * reports "env", which by then it is.
 *
 * GAP-FILL, NEVER OVERWRITE: a variable already present in the environment was
 * put there by the user's shell (or by an earlier, higher-priority source), and
 * silently replacing it would invert the documented precedence — env beats
 * keychain, always.
 *
 * IT MUST SKIP CONFIG-STORED KEYS TOO, and that is less obvious. `config.json`
 * outranks the keychain in the resolution chain, but it is NOT in `process.env`
 * — so hydrating on "absent from env" alone would push the keychain value into
 * env, where step 1 of the chain finds it FIRST and the config key that should
 * have won is never consulted. The config TUI would then sign requests with a
 * different credential than the same machine uses outside the TUI. Filtering on
 * `resolveLocalApiKey` rather than on `process.env` keeps the two identical.
 *
 * PARALLEL: reads run concurrently, so ten stored keys cost roughly one read's
 * wall clock (~30ms) rather than ten (~170ms).
 *
 * @returns the number of variables actually hydrated.
