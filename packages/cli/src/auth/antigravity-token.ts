/**
 * Antigravity shared OAuth token — read / refresh / write.
 *
 * Antigravity's own CLI (`agy`) stores its OAuth token in the macOS login
 * keychain, and claudish shares that SAME store so a single sign-in covers both
 * tools (Jack's explicit requirement). agy OWNS the refresh lifecycle too:
 * claudish never handles the Antigravity client secret in ANY form (no embed, no
 * scrape, no token exchange). When the shared token is expired, claudish asks agy
 * to refresh it — running `agy models` (a lightweight authed command that lists
 * served models, no generation quota) makes agy mint a fresh token with ITS OWN
 * current secret and write it back to the shared store. claudish then simply
 * RE-READS the store.
 *
 * Store layout (macOS login keychain):
 *   service = "gemini", account = "antigravity"
 *   value   = "go-keyring-base64:" + base64(JSON)   (zalando/go-keyring format)
 *   JSON    = { token: { access_token, token_type, refresh_token, expiry(RFC3339) },
 *               id_token, auth_method }
 *
 * Why delegate refresh: Antigravity's client_secret is a static literal baked
 * into the `agy` binary, and agy AUTO-UPDATES — each release rotates the secret
 * and Google revokes the old one — so any secret claudish embedded or scraped
 * would break within days, and there's no dynamic client registration. Letting
 * agy do the refresh means claudish is always current, holds no secret, and stays
 * out of the OAuth-client business entirely.
 *
 * Every side effect (keychain read/write/delete, the agy refresh command, clock)
 * is behind an injectable `deps` object so the module is fully testable with no
 * real keychain and no real agy process.
