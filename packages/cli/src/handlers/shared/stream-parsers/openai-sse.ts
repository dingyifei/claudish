 *   data: {"id":"…","model":"unknown","provider":"Google AI Studio",
 *          "choices":[],"error":{"code":400,"message":"…",

 * The frame has an EMPTY `choices` array, so every field the parser reads
 * (`choices[0].delta`, `choices[0].finish_reason`) is undefined and the frame
 * matched nothing at all. It was dropped without a log line, the stream ended
 * with no content and no `finish_reason`, and the turn looked like a model that
 * simply had nothing to say. Measured 2026-09-16: a 105-second session ended
 * `exit 0` with zero bytes of output twice in a row, after billing the tokens
 * its earlier successful turns had spent.
 *
 * Claudish already learned this lesson twice on other wires —
 * `stream-head-sniffer.ts` for the Codex Responses backend and
 * `devin-stream-head-sniffer.ts` for Devin, both of which open by noting that
 * "every retry hook in claudish keys off the HTTP status". The OpenAI-shaped
 * wire, which is the most used one, never got the same treatment.

 * Returns undefined when the frame carries no error, so the caller can test the
 * result directly rather than duplicating the shape-sniffing.
