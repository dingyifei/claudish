/**
 * Durable capture of upstream error bodies.
 *
 * A non-ok upstream response short-circuits before the stream parser, so
 * `response-capture` never sees it. The body is read once in ComposedHandler,
 * handed to the classifier, and then dropped:
 *
 *     const errorText = await response.text();
 *     log(`[${this.provider.displayName}] Error: ${errorText}`);
 *
 * `log()` persists nothing unless `--debug` set a log file, so on a normal run
 * that body is gone the instant it has been classified. That is the one piece
 * of evidence that distinguishes a rate limit you should retry from a hard
 * quota wall you should not, and by the time anyone wants to look at it there
 * is nothing to look at.
 *
 * Reported by @jsboige in #184, from a real incident: a GLM coding-plan 5h cap
 * saturated, the shape was reconstructable from request counts, and the literal
 * 429 body was unrecoverable.
 *
 * Opt-in, because this writes provider error text — which can carry account
 * identifiers — to a path the user names. Off by default, no directory is ever
 * created, and nothing here can throw into the request path.
