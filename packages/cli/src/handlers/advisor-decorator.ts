/**
 * `withAdvisorSwap` — the advisor for ANY main model (P4, P5, P10).
 *
 * WHY A DECORATOR
 * ===============
 * Claude Code's advisor is a SERVER tool (`advisor_20260301`), not a function
 * tool. Every foreign converter drops it, so a main model served by xAI,
 * OpenRouter, Codex, ... never sees an advisor at all (observed: the Codex
 * handler sent 28 tools upstream and no `advisor`). The advisor code used to
 * live only inside `NativeHandler`, so it ran only for native traffic.
 *
 * This wrapper does, for whatever handler the proxy resolved:
 *   1. REQUEST — swaps the server tool for claudish's function tool `advisor`
 *      BEFORE the inner handler converts anything (converters keep function
 *      tools), and rewrites earlier advisor tool_results with the panel's
 *      advice (session-keyed, retained, replayed — native-handler-advisor.ts).
 *   2. SIGNAL — `c.set("advisorSwapped", true)` when it swapped. `NativeHandler`
 *      strips the `advisor-tool-2026-03-01` beta flag on that signal: its
 *      outbound headers are built inside `NativeHandler.handle` and a wrapper
 *      cannot reach them through `ModelHandler`, and Anthropic rejects a request
 *      that enables the beta without declaring the server tool.
 *   3. RESPONSE — tees the one-shot body: one branch goes to the client
 *      unchanged, the other is scanned for advisor tool_use ids (SSE reassembled
 *      across chunk boundaries, or a non-stream JSON `content[]`).
 *
 * EXACTLY ONCE
 * ============
 * No handler under this wrapper does advisor work any more — `NativeHandler`'s
 * own swap/scan/rewrite was removed in favour of this one (option (a), see the
 * P4 implementation log). The proxy wraps the RESULT of `getHandlerForRequest`
 * once per request, never a `FallbackHandler` candidate (wrapping candidates
 * would hide them from `FallbackHandler`'s `instanceof ComposedHandler` checks
 * and drop fallback metadata). Two guards make a second application inert
 * even by mistake: `withAdvisorSwap` never wraps an `AdvisorSwapHandler`, and a
 * request whose context is already marked `advisorHandled` passes straight
 * through.
 *
 * OFF MEANS OFF (BC20)
 * ====================
 * `withAdvisorSwap` returns `inner` itself when the swap config is disabled:
 * no swap, no scan, no log records.

 * The response half. Tees the one-shot body: the client gets one branch, the

 * is cancelled too. A tee releases its source only when BOTH branches are
 * cancelled, so without that the upstream model would keep generating (and

 *
 * Backpressure: the scan branch is drained eagerly and never paused, so the

 *
 * Failures: a scan fault is logged and cancels ONLY the scan branch; the
 * client branch keeps streaming. An upstream fault reaches the client as it
