  //      is nothing to advance to and the "Out of quota" error surfaces whatever
  //      this function returns. Terminal only ever affected chains claudish
  //      assembled on the user's behalf.
  //   2. In those chains it cost availability outright. With `opencode-zen-go`
  //      now sitting ahead of the metered APIs, a bare `minimax-m2.5` hard-failed
  //      whenever the Go plan's rolling 5-hour window was spent — a request that
  //      had worked a moment earlier via the metered provider. Verified live:
  //      Zen Go answers `429 GoUsageLimitError "5-hour usage limit reached.
  //      Resets in 3hr 17min"`, and treating that as terminal stopped the chain
  //      dead instead of falling through to a provider that was ready to serve.

  // prevented at the cost of the request.

/**
 * The status an EXHAUSTED chain reports — terminal 400, or transient 503.
 *
 * This used to be a flat 502, which reads to Claude Code as a retryable transport
 * fault: it shows "API error · Retrying · attempt N/10" and the turn ends with NO
 * visible text. A chain of ONE never took this path at all — the single candidate's
 * response is returned as-is, so a 400 reached the client and Claude Code rendered
 * the reason inline (`API Error: 400 Error from provider (Console Go): …`, captured
 * verbatim in a real session's output.log). Measured side by side against a stub
 * replaying that 400: single candidate → HTTP 400 with the message; two candidates
 * → HTTP 502 with no usable text.
 *
 * That gap did not matter much while chains were built only for interactive
 * bare-name routing. Pinned chains hand it to every spawned child, so the WORST
 * case of a `team` run would have become "the model reported nothing" instead of
 * "the model reported why". Reporting a reason is the whole value of the failure.
 *
 * The split follows the same doctrine as the stream-head sniffer: terminal faults
 * are 400 so the reason surfaces inline, and only genuinely transient ones get a
 * retryable status, because retrying is the actual remedy there. Every candidate
 * being rate-limited or overloaded IS transient — Claude Code's retry loop is
 * correct for it — while an exhausted chain of capability/auth/model errors is not
 * going to fix itself, and burying it behind ten silent retries is what the
 * 400-not-5xx rule exists to prevent.
 *
 * ── The remap has to be undone HERE too (#148) ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * The transient test reads `e.status`, and by the time a candidate's error lands
 * in this array `composed-handler` may already have rewritten that status to 400.
 * So the question "was every candidate transient?" was being asked of a number
 * that no longer says. `hasQuotaExhaustionWording` covered the common case by
 * accident — a spent plan says so in words that survive the remap — but a bare
 * `Too Many Requests`, or an upstream 503 remapped for some other reason, came out
 * as a terminal 400 and Claude Code rendered a dead end where a retry was the
 * actual remedy.
 *
 * This became reachable BECAUSE of the sibling fix in `isRetryableError`. Before
 * it, a remapped 429 with no quota wording stopped the chain at the first
 * candidate, so a full chain of them never reached this function at all. Making
 * the chain advance is what surfaced the second half of the same defect.
 *
 * Scoped to 429 and 503 deliberately: exactly the set already treated as transient
 * for un-remapped statuses, so the rule becomes independent of whether a remap
 * happened rather than gaining a new one. A remapped 401/403/402 stays terminal
 * and still surfaces inline, which is the whole point of the 400 doctrine.
