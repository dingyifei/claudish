/**
 * Advisor-tool transformer for NativeHandler (monitor mode).
 *
 * PURPOSE — experimental
 * ======================
 * When the client sends `{type: "advisor_20260301", name: "advisor", model: ...}`
 * in `tools[]`, optionally replace it with a regular tool definition named
 * "advisor" so we can observe whether Sonnet still calls it as a normal tool.
 *
 * This is Stage 1 of the advisor-replacement experiment: detection only.
 * No tool loop, no third-party model routing. We just want to see whether
 * the executor still emits `tool_use` for `advisor` when the server-tool
 * version is gone.
 *
 * ENABLING
 * ========
 * Opt-in via env var:
 *
 *   export CLAUDISH_SWAP_ADVISOR=1         # swap tool + strip beta header
 *   export CLAUDISH_SWAP_ADVISOR_LOG=/tmp/advisor-swap.log  # optional log path
 *
 * When unset, this module is a no-op and the proxy behaves as before.
 *
 * STATE AND PROVENANCE (P2, P7, P8)
 * =================================
 * - Pending advisor calls are keyed by Claude Code session, then by tool-use
 *   id, and are RETAINED after their advice is delivered (see
 *   `NO_SESSION_BUCKET` and `markAdvisorCallConsumed`).
 * - Every tool_result that does not carry real advice from a named model is
 *   produced through one of the stub paths in `ADVISOR_STUB_PATHS`, and the
 *   advisor log records which one (`advisor_call`, `advisor_rewrite`).
 * - Failures reach the model as plain text naming the model and the reason,
 *   with `is_error: true`, and raise one warning per call via `logStderr`.

 * timeout. The second request now joins the first call instead of starting
 * one; after completion the cached-result path serves later turns as before.

 * flight. It is bounded like the pending state (the same per-session and

 * - `openrouter` and `google` keep `max_tokens`. Both normalise it for every
 *   model they serve, and run D proves it live (deepseek-v4-pro, HTTP 200).
 * - `openai` (api.openai.com) asks the LIVE catalog, via the same
 *   `tokenParam` field claudish's OpenAI chat-completions converter reads first
 *   (`OpenAIApiFormat.tokenParamName` → `lookupModelTokenParam`). That converter
 *   is the existing per-format rule; its catalog lookup is the part that is
 *   right, and it is reused here rather than restated. Its private name-based
 *   fallback (`gpt-5`/`o1`/`o3`/`o4` → `max_completion_tokens`) is NOT copied —
 *   a second copy of a guess is exactly what CLAUDE.md's "no hardcoded roster"
 *   rule is about, and this endpoint has a better default (below).
 *
 * ONE endpoint-level correction on the catalog's answer: `max_output_tokens` is
 * the RESPONSES-API spelling. The catalog says exactly that for gpt-5.6-sol
 * (`endpoints.openai.api === "responses"`), but the advisor always POSTs
 * `/v1/chat/completions`, which does not accept it. On this route it becomes
 * `max_completion_tokens` — the spelling OpenAI's own 400 asked for:
 *   "Unsupported parameter: 'max_tokens' is not supported with this model.
 *    Use 'max_completion_tokens' instead."
 * (observed twice for gpt-5.6-sol, runs phase7b-B and phase7b-C).
 *
 * An unknown model on the openai route defaults to `max_completion_tokens`,
 * the current chat-completions spelling; `max_tokens` is the deprecated one and
 * is precisely what the newer models reject.
