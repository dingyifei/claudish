/**
 * session-discovery — find resumable Claude Code sessions, grouped by worktree.
 *
 * Claude Code stores one JSONL transcript per session at
 * `~/.claude/projects/<slugged-cwd>/<session-uuid>.jsonl`. The FILENAME is the id
 * `claude --resume` takes, so nothing here has to parse a file to know what to resume.
 *
 * SCALE IS THE DESIGN CONSTRAINT, and it is not hypothetical. MEASURED on this machine:
 * 5,656 transcripts across 219 project directories, 2.57 GB in total, the largest single
 * file 73.5 MB. Reading transcripts to build a list is therefore off the table — it
 * would be gigabytes of I/O to draw one screen. Two rules follow, and everything below
 * is shaped by them:
 *
 *   1. THE LIST IS BUILT FROM DIRECTORY NAMES AND `stat` ALONE. Grouping, worktree
 *      identity and recency all come from the path and the mtime, so opening a
 *      transcript is never on the path to a rendered row.
 *   2. DETAIL IS HYDRATED LAZILY, AND ONLY IN BOUNDED CHUNKS. `hydrateSession` reads a
 *      64 KB head and a 128 KB tail with positioned reads — never the middle, never the
 *      whole file — so a 73 MB transcript costs the same as a 73 KB one.
