/**
 * session-summary — the bordered card claudish prints when a session ends.
 *
 * Printed as raw ANSI after the proxy has shut down, so it lands in the scrollback and
 * survives scrolling back to it later. Same pattern, and same reason, as
 * `probe-results-printer.ts`.
 *
 * THE RESUME COMMAND IS DELIBERATELY OUTSIDE THE BOX. Inside it would be framed by `│`
 * on both sides, and selecting a line in a terminal takes the whole row — so copying it
 * would drag the border characters along and the pasted command would not run. It is
 * printed as one bare, unstyled line below the card, which is the only form that
 * double-click-and-copy handles cleanly.
 *
 * The visual contract this follows (from the `opentui-tui` skill, which claudish's probe
 * UI already follows): a bounded value gets a GRADIENT METER rather than a bare number,
 * a category distribution gets a STACKED BAR rather than `name: count` lines, and a
 * discrete status gets a BADGE. No emoji anywhere — ambiguous width breaks column
 * alignment, and Jack asked for the probe TUI's look, which uses none.
