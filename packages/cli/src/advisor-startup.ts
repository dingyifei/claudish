/**
 * `--advisor` startup: the refusals and the notice.
 *
 * Design rule (requirements.md, decided Q3): anything claudish can determine at
 * LAUNCH is a refusal at startup with a named reason and a non-zero exit. Runtime
 * warnings are only for what cannot be known until the child is running. R5
 * forbids the alternative — a session that silently has no advisor looks exactly
 * like one that works.
 *
 * Refusals, in order:
 *   1. `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ADVISOR_TOOL` is true in the child's environment.
 *      The enable variable does not override it, so no advisor tool is offered.
 *   2. A main-model path whose wire format drops every tool. Decided from the
 *      RESOLVED provider's transport and a probe of that format's
 *      `convertTools`, never from a model list.
 *   3. No panel models.
 *   4. ANY panel model whose credential does not resolve. Each panel model
 *      calls one host with one metered key (never a subscription); a missing
 *      key is known now, so it is refused now rather than returning an error
 *      section on every advisor call.
 *   5. A collector the user NAMED whose credential does not resolve. A
 *      DEFAULTED collector (`haiku`, supplied by parseAdvisorFlag) is instead
 *      dropped — see `decideAdvisorStartup`.
 *
 * Which host and which credential a model uses is NOT decided here: it is the
 * advisor call path's own routing (`advisorRouteFor`, native-handler-advisor.ts),
 * so startup and runtime cannot drift apart. Credentials are resolved through
 * the credential authority — env, config, keychain, 1Password — exactly as the
 * runtime resolves them; an `--advisor` launch is their point of need.
 *
 * Everything that decides is exported and side-effect free
 * (`decideAdvisorStartup` and its helpers). The only I/O is credential
 * resolution, isolated in `resolveAdvisorCredentials` and injectable into
 * `evaluateAdvisorStartup`. Printing, exiting and applying the effective
 * collector belong to the caller (index.ts).
 *
 * Output channel: the caller writes the notice to STDERR before the child
 * spawns. In `-p` mode stdout carries Claude Code's (often machine-readable)
 * output and nothing else; see ai-docs/architecture/headless-vs-interactive.md.
 * Terminal isolation (terminal-isolation.ts) is not active yet at that point, so
 * the write reaches the terminal instead of being diverted to the log.
