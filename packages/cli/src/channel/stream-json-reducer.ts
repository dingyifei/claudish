/**
 * StreamJsonReducer — turns a child's `--output-format stream-json` NDJSON into
 * channel state, prose, and accounting.
 *
 * ## What it replaces, and why
 *
 * `SignalWatcher` inferred state by regex-matching Claude Code's INTERACTIVE TUI
 * glyphs (`⏺ Read`, spinner text) against the output of a child running in PRINT
 * mode, which emits none of them. Every pattern was therefore dead from the day
 * it shipped: `feed()` never matched, the machine never left `starting`, and the
 * only transition that ever fired was the one driven by process exit. Two real
 * sessions ran 15 minutes, made 93 tool calls and generated 68 k output tokens,
 * and were recorded as `turnsCompleted: 0, tokensUsed: 0, status: "completed"`
 * with a 0-byte output log.
 *
 * The fix is not a better regex. The child can be asked to *declare* its state,
 * and 2.1.239 does: `--output-format stream-json` emits one JSON object per line
 * for every message, tool call, hook and turn boundary, and `result` carries
 * `terminal_reason` / `is_error` / `api_error_status` / `num_turns` / `usage`.
 * Transitions become facts instead of guesses.
 *
 * ## Three rules that are load-bearing
 *
 * 1. **Deltas are consumed and discarded.** With `--include-partial-messages` a
 *    long session emits 20–60 k `stream_event` frames (~230 B each, 5–14 MB).
 *    Storing them would evict all 2 000 lines of `ScrollbackBuffer` within
 *    seconds and leave a ring full of three-character text fragments. They exist
 *    here to prove the child is alive — nothing more.
 *
 * 2. **Per-line degradation, never latching.** Only a line that is BOTH valid
 *    JSON AND carries a recognised `type` is treated as an event. Anything else
 *    goes to the answer verbatim. This is not defensive padding: a real run of
 *    `claude 2.1.239` put `Client.listTools() called but server does not
 *    advertise tools capability - returning empty list` on stdout, mid-stream.
 *    Sniffing the format once from the first line would have been cheaper and
 *    would have silently disabled recovery for the whole run.
 *
 * 3. **Terminal states are absorbing.** The 900-second silent success was
 *    manufactured by a guard that blocked only `cancelled`, so a process exit
 *    could *upgrade* a `failed` the timeout handler had already decided. The
 *    transition table below makes every terminal state absorbing, and an attempt
 *    to leave one is recorded rather than obeyed.
