// ─── SessionManager ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Lifecycle owner for channel sessions. Each session is one `claudish` child
// spawned over plain pipes, driven by BIDIRECTIONAL stream-json:
//
//   parent ──{"type":"user",…}──▶ proc.stdin ─inherit─▶ claude's fd 0
//   parent ◀── NDJSON frames ──── proc.stdout ◀─inherit─ claude's fd 1
//
// There is no relay code in between. `claudish` is spawned WITHOUT `--stdin`, so
// nothing in it consumes fd 0, and it spawns `claude` with `stdio: "inherit"` —
// which means the pipe this file creates lands directly on the grandchild.
// Verified end to end on 2026-08-22 against claude 2.1.239 (see
// ai-docs/sessions/dev-feature-stream-json-*/probes/probe-argv.ts).
//
// What that buys, in order of how badly it was needed:
//   * progress that is real — the child declares its state instead of us
//     regex-matching TUI glyphs it never prints (see stream-json-reducer.ts)
//   * `send_input` that works — it has never worked before; the bytes used to
//     land in an already-satisfied stdin drain
//   * a terminal state that has to be earned — `result.terminal_reason` plus
//     `classifyRunOutput`, instead of "exit code 0 means success"
//   * real tokens and cost — `CLAUDISH_TOKEN_FILE` points the child's own token
//     tracker at this session's directory

   * List sessions. IN-MEMORY ONLY — deliberately, and this one was measured.

   * The three id-addressed readers fall back to `<sessionsDir>/<id>/`, so the
   * obvious symmetry would be for this to enumerate that directory. It does not,
   * for two reasons found by measuring the real one (9 946 session directories
   * on this machine; nothing prunes them, so it only grows):
   *
   * 1. COST. Session ids carry no ordering, so "the newest N" requires a `stat`
   *    of every entry: 40 ms warm, 144 ms cold, synchronously, on the same
   *    thread that pumps every live session's stdout — per call, on a tool an
   *    agent POLLS.
   * 2. A BOUNDED scan does not fix that, it makes the answer wrong. `readdir`
   *    order on APFS is uncorrelated with recency: the last 2 000 of those 9 946
   *    dirents contained 9 of the 50 genuinely-newest sessions. A capped
   *    enumeration would present an arbitrary 18 % sample as "the session list",
   *    and a caller cannot tell a sampled-out session from one that never
   *    existed. Returning a list that is honestly "what this process is holding"
   *    beats returning a lottery.
   *
   * Nothing is lost that matters: recovery is id-addressed and O(1) — one open
   * of a known path — and the id is always in the caller's hand, because both
   * `create_session` and every channel notification carry it. Discovery by
   * browsing is a directory listing, not a diagnostic.
