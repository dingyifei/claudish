 * because `EVENT_TO_TASK_STATUS` (mcp-server.ts) maps the event enum onto
 * SEP-1686's 5-value `TaskStatus` and had **no `"timeout"` key**: it fell
 * through to `?? "working"`, so emitting `"timeout"` reported a dead session as
 * still working. The timeout path therefore recorded `"timeout"` and emitted
 * `"failed"`, and a consumer watching only the wire could not tell a session
 * that ran out of time from one that errored.
 *
 * `["timeout", "failed"]` now exists in that map — SEP-1686 has no `timeout`
 * member and `failed` is its only honest projection — so the divergence is gone
 * and `ReducerEvent` no longer carries a `sessionStatus` override.
